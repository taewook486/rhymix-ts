---

## Implementation Guide

### Quick Start Workflow

Database Stack Initialization:

Create a DatabaseManager instance and configure multiple database connections. Set up PostgreSQL with connection string, pool size of 20, and query logging enabled. Configure MongoDB with connection string, database name, and sharding enabled. Configure Redis with connection string, max connections of 50, and clustering enabled. Use the unified interface to query user data with profile and analytics across all database types.

Single Database Operations:

Run PostgreSQL schema migrations using the migration command with the database type and migration file path. Execute MongoDB aggregation pipelines by specifying the collection name and pipeline JSON file. Warm Redis cache by specifying key patterns and TTL values.

### Core Components

PostgreSQL Module:

- Advanced schema design and constraints
- Complex query optimization and indexing
- Window functions and CTEs
- Partitioning and materialized views
- Connection pooling and performance tuning

MongoDB Module:

- Document modeling and schema design
- Aggregation pipelines for analytics
- Indexing strategies and performance
- Sharding and scaling patterns
- Data consistency and validation

Redis Module:

- Multi-layer caching strategies
- Real-time analytics and counting
- Distributed locking and coordination
- Pub/sub messaging and streams
- Advanced data structures including HyperLogLog and Geo

Oracle Module:

- Hierarchical and recursive query patterns (CONNECT BY)
- PL/SQL procedures, packages, and batch operations
- Partitioning strategies (range, list, hash, composite)
- Enterprise features and statement caching
- LOB handling and large data processing

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Database Architecture

Polyglot Persistence Pattern:

Create a DataRouter class that initializes connections to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Oracle. Implement get_user_profile method that retrieves structured user data from PostgreSQL or Oracle, flexible profile data from MongoDB, and real-time status from Redis, then merges all data sources. Implement update_user_data method that routes structured data updates to PostgreSQL/Oracle, profile data updates to MongoDB, and real-time data updates to Redis, followed by cache invalidation.

Data Synchronization:

Create a DataSyncManager class that synchronizes user data across databases. Implement sync_user_data method that retrieves user from PostgreSQL, creates a search document for MongoDB, upserts to the MongoDB search collection, creates cache data, and updates Redis cache with TTL.

### Performance Optimization

Query Performance Analysis:

For PostgreSQL, execute EXPLAIN ANALYZE BUFFERS on queries and use a QueryAnalyzer to generate optimization suggestions. For MongoDB, create an AggregationOptimizer to analyze and optimize aggregation pipelines. For Redis, retrieve info metrics and use a PerformanceAnalyzer to generate recommendations.

Scaling Strategies:

Configure PostgreSQL read replicas by providing replica connection URLs. Set up MongoDB sharding with shard key and number of shards. Configure Redis clustering by providing node URLs for the cluster.

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="rationalizations" -->
## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I do not need an index, the table is small" | Tables grow. The missing index that is invisible at 1K rows becomes a production incident at 1M rows. |
| "I will add the migration later" | Schema changes without migrations are unreproducible. Every change must have a reversible migration script. |
| "This query works fine in development" | Development databases have tiny datasets. Production query plans differ dramatically at scale. Explain analyze first. |
| "NoSQL does not need schema design" | Schemaless does not mean designless. Document structure decisions affect every query and index. |
| "I will just add a column, it is non-breaking" | Adding a NOT NULL column without a default breaks existing inserts. Column additions need default values or migration backfills. |
| "Connection pooling is handled by the framework" | Framework defaults are generic. Pool size, timeout, and idle limits must be tuned to the workload. |

<!-- moai:evolvable-end -->

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="red-flags" -->
## Red Flags

- Schema change committed without a corresponding migration file
- Query uses SELECT * in production code instead of explicit column list
- No index exists for columns used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses
- Connection string hardcoded in source instead of environment variable
- Transaction scope spans user-facing HTTP request duration (long-held locks)
- No EXPLAIN ANALYZE output for new queries touching large tables

<!-- moai:evolvable-end -->

<!-- moai:evolvable-start id="verification" -->
## Verification

- [ ] Migration file exists for every schema change (show migration file list)
- [ ] Indexes exist for frequently queried columns (show index definitions)
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE run for new queries on representative data (show output)
- [ ] Connection credentials sourced from environment variables
- [ ] Transaction scopes are minimal and do not span I/O waits
- [ ] Backup and restore procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Connection pool settings configured with explicit size and timeout

## Cloud Vendor Guide (absorbed from moai-platform-database-cloud)

Cloud database platform selection and configuration for Neon, Supabase, and Firebase Firestore.

### Quick Decision Guide

| Need | Platform |
|------|----------|
| Serverless PostgreSQL with auto-scaling | Neon |
| Database branching for CI/CD previews | Neon branching |
| Edge-compatible connection pooling | Neon + Neon Proxy |
| Vector search (pgvector) for AI/ML | Supabase |
| Row-Level Security for multi-tenant apps | Supabase RLS |
| Real-time subscriptions + full-stack | Supabase |
| Mobile-first with offline sync | Firebase Firestore |
| Cross-platform (iOS/Android/Web) | Firebase Firestore |

### Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL)

Key features: Auto-scaling compute, scale-to-zero, database branching, pg_bouncer pooling.

Setup:
```bash
npm install @neondatabase/serverless
# Connection string: postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Branch workflow: Create a branch per PR (`neonctl branches create --name pr-123`), run migrations, test, delete on merge. Zero cost during idle periods.

### Supabase (PostgreSQL 16)

Key features: pgvector, Row-Level Security, real-time subscriptions, built-in auth/storage.

RLS policy pattern:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "users_own_data" ON items
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

pgvector search: `SELECT * FROM embeddings ORDER BY embedding <-> $1 LIMIT 10;`

### Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)

Key features: Real-time sync, offline caching, Security Rules, mobile SDKs.

Security Rules pattern:
```javascript
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

Offline persistence: Enable via `enableIndexedDbPersistence(db)` (web) or SDK default (mobile).

## Refactor Notes

**Refactor scope** (deferred to future sub-SPEC):
- Separate moai-domain-db-docs workflow skill from this query/schema design skill
- Extract cloud vendor deep-dives (Neon, Supabase, Firestore) into dedicated Level-3 modules
- Consolidate overlapping ORM pattern content across database types

This skill is retained in v3.0 but its body will be restructured in a follow-up SPEC. Cloud vendor content absorbed from moai-platform-database-cloud in Wave 1.2.
