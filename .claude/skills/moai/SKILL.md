## Routing Observation Ledger

When dispatching a subcommand or workflow, the orchestrator records the routing decision to the append-only routing-ledger (`.moai/state/routing-ledger.jsonl`) via `moai harness ledger record` at dispatch time — the request text is piped via stdin and only a privacy-preserving digest is stored, never verbatim user text. As the routed pipeline reaches gate points, machine evidence is appended via `moai harness ledger evidence` (gate exits, audit verdicts, verify-log paths). Outcome is never supplied as an input; it is finalized from machine evidence only. This observation is opt-in and fail-open — it never blocks routing, and it is a silent no-op unless the harness observability opt-in is enabled.

## Intent Router

### Raw User Input

$ARGUMENTS

### Routing Instructions

[HARD] Route the Raw User Input above using the strict priority order below. Extract the FIRST WORD of the input for subcommand matching. All text after the subcommand keyword is CONTEXT to be passed to the matched workflow — it is NOT a routing signal and MUST NOT influence which workflow is selected.

## Execution Mode Flags (mutually exclusive)

- `--team`: Force Mode 3 (agent-team) of the Phase 4 6-mode catalog (`.claude/rules/moai/workflow/orchestration-mode-selection.md` §A), subject to its capability gate
- `--solo`: Force Mode 5 (sub-agent — single sequential agent per phase)
- No flag: The orchestrator auto-selects from the full 6-mode catalog at Phase 4; the complexity auto-select thresholds are stated once in `orchestration-mode-selection.md` §B.1 (machine source: `workflow.yaml` `auto_selection`) and are not restated here

The `--team` / `--solo` flags are forced overrides onto the catalog; the flag-free default resolves through the catalog decision tree (§B) and its capability gates. The `--mode` dispatch axis is a separate axis — see the crosswalk in `orchestration-mode-selection.md` §G.1 (correspondence, not merge).

### Priority 1: Explicit Subcommand Matching

[HARD] Extract the FIRST WORD from the Raw User Input section above. If it matches any subcommand below (or its alias), route to that workflow IMMEDIATELY. Do NOT analyze the remaining text for routing — it is context for the matched workflow:

- **plan** (aliases: spec): SPEC document creation workflow
- **run** (aliases: impl): DDD/TDD implementation workflow (per quality.yaml development_mode)
- **sync** (aliases: docs, pr): Documentation synchronization and PR creation
- **project** (aliases: init): Project documentation generation
- **feedback** (aliases: fb, bug, issue): GitHub issue creation
- **fix**: Auto-fix errors in a single pass
- **loop**: Iterative auto-fix until completion conditions are satisfied
- **mx**: MX tag scan and annotation for codebase
- **review** (aliases: code-review): Code review with security and MX tag compliance
- **clean** (aliases: dead-code): Identify and safely remove dead code
- **codemaps**: Generate architecture documentation in `.moai/project/codemaps/`
- **gate** (aliases: check, pre-commit): Lightweight pre-commit quality gate (lint+format+type-check+test)
- **e2e** (aliases: e2e-test, end-to-end): Multi-platform end-to-end testing (web/mobile/desktop) with project-type auto-detection and CLI-first toolchain selection
- **harness** (aliases: hrn, learn): harness lifecycle management — learning-lifecycle verbs (status / apply / rollback &lt;date&gt; / disable) + v4-lifecycle verbs (list / edit / remove / doctor), all dispatching through the unified `moai harness` Go-binary Cobra subcommand tree; the slash command is the documented user-facing entry point
- **goal**: Condition-declared universal agentic loop — arm a completion condition (`/moai goal "<condition>"`), check status, clear, or resume; evaluated each turn-end by the `stop-goal` Stop hook

### Priority 2: SPEC-ID Detection

Only if Priority 1 did not match: Check if the Raw User Input contains a pattern matching SPEC-XXX (such as SPEC-AUTH-001). If found, route to the **run** workflow automatically. The SPEC-ID becomes the target for DDD/TDD implementation.

### Priority 3: Natural Language Classification

Only if BOTH Priority 1 AND Priority 2 did not match: Classify the intent of the ENTIRE Raw User Input as natural language. This priority is NEVER reached when the first word matches a known subcommand.

[HARD] The cue words listed below are **English exemplars**, NOT literal-match requirements. Classify intent semantically for any `conversation_language` — a Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or other-language request expressing the same intent routes identically. Do not require the literal English tokens to appear.

- Planning and design language (design, architect, plan, spec, requirements, feature request) routes to **plan**
- Quality gate language (format, check, pre-commit, quality gate) routes to **gate**
- E2E and user-journey testing language (e2e, end-to-end test, browser test, mobile app test, desktop app test, user journey) routes to **e2e** — semantic exemplars; any conversation_language expressing e2e-testing intent routes identically
- Security language (security, audit, owasp, vulnerability, injection, xss, csrf) routes to **review** (with `--security` scope)
- Error and fix language (fix, error, bug, broken, failing, lint) routes to **fix**
- Iterative and repeat language (keep fixing, until done, repeat, iterate, all errors) routes to **loop**
- Documentation language (document, sync, docs, readme, changelog, PR) routes to **sync** or **project**
- Feedback and bug report language (report, feedback, suggestion, issue) routes to **feedback**
- MX tag language (mx tag, annotation, code context, legacy annotate) routes to **mx**
- Implementation language (implement, build, create, add, develop) with clear scope routes to **moai** (default autonomous)

### Priority 4: Default Behavior

If the intent remains ambiguous after all priority checks, use AskUserQuestion to present the top 2-3 matching workflows and let the user choose.

If the intent is clearly a development task with no specific routing signal, default to the **moai** workflow (plan -> run -> sync pipeline) for full autonomous execution.

### harness - Harness Lifecycle + Natural-Language Build (argument-branching)

This single `harness` subcommand dispatches to ONE of two workflows based on the FIRST token of `$ARGUMENTS` (argument-based routing — no second command is introduced). Apply the routing rule before any workflow-specific logic:

- **Reserved verb** (`status` / `apply` / `rollback` / `disable`) → route to the existing **harness learning lifecycle** workflow (Branch A below). This path is unchanged.
- **Reserved verb** (`list` / `edit` / `remove` / `doctor`) → route to the **harness-v4 lifecycle** handler (Branch A.1 below). These enumerate / edit / atomically-remove harness-v4 entries and run the reference-integrity smoke gate (`doctor`) via the `moai harness <verb>` Go binary subcommand.
- **Anything else** (a natural-language harness-creation request, e.g. "build a harness for CLI template development") → route to the **harness build entry** workflow (Branch B below).

#### Branch A — harness learning lifecycle (reserved verbs: status / apply / rollback / disable)

Purpose: Surface the harness learning subsystem (observer, 4-tier proposal ladder, 5-layer safety pipeline) to the user via the slash command path. The lifecycle verbs (status / apply / rollback / disable) dispatch through the unified `moai harness` Go-binary Cobra subcommand tree, which performs the file-system operations. Tier-4 application is gated by orchestrator-issued AskUserQuestion.
Skills: moai-harness-learner (Tier-4 surfacing companion). Project-specific harness generation is handled by the v4 Builder (`builder-harness` agent, Branch B).
Verbs: status (tier distribution + telemetry) | apply (next Tier-4 proposal → AskUserQuestion → 5-layer pipeline → snapshot + write) | rollback &lt;YYYY-MM-DD&gt; (restore snapshot) | disable (set learning.enabled: false)
Artifacts: `.moai/harness/usage-log.jsonl`, `.moai/harness/proposals/`, `.moai/harness/learning-history/snapshots/`, `.moai/harness/learning-history/applied/`, `.moai/harness/learning-history/frozen-guard-violations.jsonl`
Authoritative SPEC: the harness foundation policy (supersedes V3R3-HARNESS-001, V3R3-HARNESS-LEARNING-001, V3R3-PROJECT-HARNESS-001)
For detailed orchestration: Read ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/harness.md

#### Branch A.1 — harness-v4 lifecycle (reserved verbs: list / edit / remove / doctor)

Purpose: Manage harness-v4 entries — enumerate built harnesses, locate their manifest + specialist files for editing, atomically remove a harness with all its artifacts, or run the reference-integrity smoke gate. The four verbs dispatch to the `moai harness <verb>` Go binary subcommand which performs the filesystem work (scan `.claude/commands/harness/*.md` joined with `manifest.json`; atomic remove with fail-closed orphan prevention; doctor cross-references manifest/specialist/skill file existence).
Verbs: list (enumerate all harnesses: name + domain + entry command, plus the declared schedule — interval + mechanism — when the manifest declares one; schedule-less harnesses render identically to the pre-schedule baseline) | edit &lt;name&gt; (show manifest + specialist + skill paths for editing — manifest is the SSOT) | remove &lt;name&gt; (atomic removal of command + workflow + specialists + skills + manifest; fail-closed if any artifact is missing; when the manifest declared a schedule, prints an unregister notice naming the declared mechanism — CronDelete for cron, session-scoped loop cancellation for loop — computed from the manifest before deletion) | doctor (reference-integrity smoke gate: verifies every built harness's manifest/specialist/skill files exist and cross-reference correctly; a schema-invalid schedule declaration is an ERROR-severity finding)
CLI: `moai harness list [--json]`, `moai harness edit <name> [--json]`, `moai harness remove <name>`, `moai harness doctor` (all support `--project-root`)
Artifacts: `.claude/commands/harness/<name>.md` (thin-wrapper command), `.claude/commands/harness/<name>/manifest.json` (SSOT), `.claude/workflows/hns-<name>-run.js` (Runner), `.claude/agents/harness/hns-<name>*-specialist.md` (specialists), `.claude/skills/hns-<name>*/` (companion skills)
Namespace: `.claude/commands/harness/`, `.claude/workflows/hns-*.js`, `.claude/agents/harness/`, and `.claude/skills/hns-*/` are USER-OWNED — `moai update` preserves them (backup if needed, never overwrites). Legacy generations with the `harness-` or `my-harness-` prefix are equally preserved (recognition-based backward compatibility); the Builder emits `hns-` names only.

#### Branch B — harness build entry (natural-language request)

Purpose: Turn a natural-language harness-creation request into a concrete harness via Context-First Discovery (extract domain / goal / constraints / scope), harness `<name>` derivation (the name is derived from the request — NOT statically supplied by the user), explicit orchestrator-issued approval, then transition into the orchestrator-direct Builder (4 signal-driven phases: ANALYZE / PLAN / GENERATE / ACTIVATE). The orchestrator MUST conduct AskUserQuestion Socratic rounds (max 4 questions per round) when intent clarity is below 100%.
Agent: builder-harness (v4 Builder — project-specific harness generation)
Builder: orchestrator-direct processing (NOT a dynamic-workflow script) — the entry's Phases 0-3 hand off to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/harness-builder.md` for the 4-phase creation logic. The orchestrator holds the PLAN→GENERATE AskUserQuestion approval gate directly; that gate round also carries the recurrence question (optional manifest `schedule`, discovery-only scheduled runs), and ACTIVATE registers a declared schedule after the smoke gate. A request referencing an EXISTING harness together with scheduling intent routes to the entry workflow's Schedule Retrofit branch (evaluated before name-collision handling) instead of the creation pipeline.

## Execution Directive

When this skill is activated, execute the following steps in order:

Step 1 - Parse Arguments:
Extract subcommand keywords and flags from the Raw User Input. Recognized global flags: --resume [ID], --seq, --team, --solo. Also detect `ultrathink` keyword in the input text.

**CRITICAL: Deep analysis mode:**
- `ultrathink` keyword detected → Activate Claude's native extended reasoning (xhigh effort mode). This is native Claude behavior with no MCP dependency.

Step 1.5 - Flag-Subcommand Compatibility Validation:
[HARD] After parsing the subcommand and flags (Step 1), validate flag-subcommand compatibility BEFORE routing. If a forbidden combination is detected, STOP all further processing and output an error in the user's conversation_language. Do NOT proceed to Step 2.

Forbidden flag-subcommand combinations:

| Flag | Allowed subcommands | Forbidden subcommands |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `--worktree` | `plan` | `run`, `sync`, default (autonomous) |
| `--branch` | `plan`, default (autonomous) | `run`, `sync` |

Rationale: `--worktree` provisions an isolated workspace at SPEC initialization; only `/moai plan --worktree` creates one, so `/moai run` and `/moai sync` MUST operate within the worktree already established during `plan` — re-creating during run/sync corrupts the SPEC lifecycle and is rejected at the router level. `--branch` (feature-branch creation) is parsed at both `plan` and the default autonomous pipeline, but remains forbidden for `run`/`sync` for the same re-creation-corruption reason.

Error message template (Korean conversation_language; substitute the actual flag and subcommand):
```
에러: --worktree 플래그는 /moai plan 전용입니다.
/moai run 과 /moai sync 는 plan 단계에서 생성된 기존 worktree/branch를 재사용합니다.

올바른 사용법:
  /moai plan SPEC-XXX --worktree    (worktree 생성)
  /moai run SPEC-XXX                (기존 worktree/branch 재사용)
  /moai sync SPEC-XXX               (기존 worktree/branch 재사용)

다시 실행하려면 --worktree 플래그를 제거한 형태로 호출하세요.
```

For English (`en` conversation_language), translate the message; the structure remains identical.

Step 2 - Route to Workflow:
Apply the Intent Router (Priority 1 through Priority 4) to determine the target workflow. If ambiguous, use AskUserQuestion to clarify with the user.

Step 2.5 - Project Documentation Check:
Before executing plan, run, sync, fix, loop, or default workflows, verify project documentation exists by checking for `.moai/project/product.md`. If product.md does NOT exist, use AskUserQuestion to ask the user (in their conversation_language):

Question: Project documentation not found. Would you like to create it first?
Options:
- Create project documentation (Recommended): Generates product.md, structure.md, tech.md through a guided interview. This helps MoAI understand your project context for better results in all subsequent workflows.
- Skip and continue: Proceed without project documentation. MoAI will have less context about your project.

This check does NOT apply to: project, feedback subcommands.

[HARD] Beginner-Friendly Option Design:
All AskUserQuestion calls throughout MoAI workflows MUST follow these rules:
- The first option MUST always be the recommended choice, clearly marked with "(Recommended)" suffix
- Every option MUST include a detailed description explaining what it does and its implications

Step 2.8 - Requirement Analysis & Completion Condition:
Before loading the workflow body (Step 3), produce a requirement-analysis record for the routed request:

1. **Requirement summary** (1-3 sentences): what the user asked for, restated in the orchestrator's own words.
2. **Completion condition**: the end state that means "done". Where the condition is machine-verifiable (test exit code, lint-clean state, grep count, bounded turn count), express it in `/goal`-compatible transcript-measurable form per `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/goal-directive.md` (one measurable end state + a stated check + a bound clause). Do NOT invent a parallel evaluator: set the condition via `/goal` when the runtime supports it; otherwise the orchestrator evaluates the identical condition text per-turn (graceful degradation — no new machinery).
3. **Pipeline contract**: `full-pipeline` (default natural-language route — run-phase completion auto-chains into sync) or `single-phase` (explicit `run`/`sync` subcommand — chaining is offered as the "(Recommended)" next-step option, never fired silently).
4. **Orchestration-shape pre-signal**: an early input to the Phase 4 6-mode selection (`orchestration-mode-selection.md` §A) — noted here, decided at Phase 4.

Trivial-scope exemption: skip this step entirely for `feedback`, `gate`, `codemaps`, `sync` status mode, and any Stage-1-Clarify exception per `askuser-protocol.md` § Ambiguity Triggers and Exceptions.
Socratic-first ordering: while intent clarity is below 100%, run the Socratic interview (per `askuser-protocol.md`) BEFORE deriving the completion condition — the condition encodes drained intent, never a guess.
A derived completion condition NEVER authorizes autonomous run-phase entry — Implementation Kickoff Approval remains mandatory at the plan→run boundary.

Step 3 - Load Workflow Details:
Read `workflows/<name>.md` for the target subcommand. (The Agent Teams static layer is retired; a `--team` flag falls back to sub-agent mode per `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/orchestration-mode-selection.md` — there is no separate `team/<name>.md` workflow file.)

Step 4 - Read Configuration:
Load relevant configuration from .moai/config/config.yaml and section files as needed.

Step 5 - Initialize Task Tracking:
Use TaskCreate to register discovered work items with pending status.

Step 6 - Execute Workflow Phases:
Follow the workflow-specific phase instructions. Delegate all implementation to appropriate agents via Agent(). Collect user approvals at designated checkpoints via AskUserQuestion. Before each implementation/review Agent() spawn, apply `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/skill-routing.md` §1: inject 0-3 `At start, invoke Skill("<name>") for <reason>` lines per the delegation map (`.moai/config/sections/delegation.yaml`).

Step 7 - Track Progress:
Update task status using TaskUpdate as work progresses (pending to in_progress to completed).

Step 8 - Present Results:
Display results to the user in their conversation_language using Markdown format.

Step 9 - Declare Completion:
When all workflow phases complete successfully, state that the workflow is complete in the Completion Report (banner / prose) so the result is unambiguous.

Step 10 - Guide Next Steps:
Use AskUserQuestion to present the user with logical next actions based on the completed workflow.
