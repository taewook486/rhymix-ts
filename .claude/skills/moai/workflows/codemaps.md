# Workflow: Codemaps - Architecture Documentation Generation

Purpose: Scan the codebase and generate architecture documentation in `.moai/project/codemaps/` directory. Creates human-readable and AI-consumable maps of modules, dependencies, entry points, and interaction patterns.

Flow: Explore Codebase -> Analyze Architecture -> Generate Maps -> Verify -> Report

## Supported Flags

- --force (alias --regenerate): Regenerate all codemaps even if they already exist
- --area AREA: Focus on a specific area (e.g., --area api, --area auth, --area cli)
- --format FORMAT: Output format (default: markdown). Options: markdown, mermaid, json
- --depth N: Maximum directory depth for exploration (default: 4)

## Pipeline Contract (Agentless Classification)

<!-- @MX:NOTE - Agentless fixed-pipeline classification; localize→repair→validate contract. See spec-workflow.md#subcommand-classification. -->

This subcommand is classified as **Agentless fixed-pipeline**.
It executes a deterministic 3-phase contract: **localize → repair → validate**.

- **Phase mapping**: localize ← Phase 1; repair ← Phase 2+3; validate ← Phase 4
- **No LLM-driven control flow**: Agent() invocations exist for executor delegation within phases (e.g., `Explore` for codebase analysis) but never select the next phase.
- **No-op exit**: When the localize phase finds zero targets, the pipeline exits with status `no-op` and exit code 0, skipping repair and validate.
- **Fail-fast**: When repair encounters an unresolvable error, the pipeline terminates and reports the error. There is no multi-agent fallback.
- **`--mode` flag handling**: Any `--mode` flag passed to this subcommand is ignored. The system logs `MODE_FLAG_IGNORED_FOR_UTILITY` at info level and proceeds with the fixed pipeline.
- **Repeatability**: Even when the parent invocation supplies `--mode loop`, the pipeline runs once per command invocation. Re-entry requires explicit user re-invocation.

See [Subcommand Classification matrix](../../rules/moai/workflow/spec-workflow.md#subcommand-classification) for the full pipeline-vs-multi-agent contract.

## Phase 1: Codebase Exploration

[HARD] Delegate codebase exploration to the Explore subagent.

Exploration Objectives passed to Explore agent:

- Directory Structure: Map all top-level and significant subdirectories
- Module Boundaries: Identify package/module boundaries and their responsibilities
- Entry Points: Find main entry points (main.go, index.ts, app.py, etc.)
- Public APIs: List exported functions, types, and interfaces
- Dependency Graph: Map inter-module dependencies (imports, requires)
- External Dependencies: Catalog third-party dependencies with purposes
- Configuration Files: Identify build, deployment, and config files

If --area flag: Limit exploration to the specified area and its dependencies.

Expected Output from Explore agent:

- Module inventory with purpose descriptions
- Dependency adjacency list (who imports whom)
- Entry point catalog
- Technology stack summary
- Architecture pattern identification (MVC, Clean, Hexagonal, etc.)

## Phase 2: Architecture Analysis

The orchestrator performs architecture analysis directly (no Agent() spawn) from the Phase 1 exploration output plus deterministic tooling (e.g., `go list -deps -json` + `go doc`, or the project language's equivalent dependency/doc extractors) — replacing the former analysis delegation spawn.

Analysis inputs:

- Explore agent results from Phase 1
- Existing .moai/project/codemaps/ content (if --force not set, for incremental updates)
- Output format preference (from --format flag)

Analysis Tasks:

- Classify modules by layer (presentation, business, data, infrastructure)
- Identify high fan-in modules (potential @MX:ANCHOR candidates)
- Detect circular dependencies
- Map request/data flow paths
- Identify domain boundaries

## Phase 3: Map Generation

The orchestrator generates the maps directly (no Agent() spawn) from the Phase 2 analysis — replacing the former generation delegation spawn. Phase 1's Explore spawn remains the workflow's single Agent() invocation.

Output Files in `.moai/project/codemaps/` directory:

- `overview.md`: High-level architecture summary with module descriptions
- `modules.md`: Detailed module catalog with responsibilities and dependencies
- `dependencies.md`: Dependency graph (text and/or mermaid diagram)
- `entry-points.md`: Entry point catalog with invocation paths
- `data-flow.md`: Key data flow paths through the system

If --area flag: Generate only area-specific maps:
- `.moai/project/codemaps/{area}/overview.md`
- `.moai/project/codemaps/{area}/modules.md`
- `.moai/project/codemaps/{area}/dependencies.md`

If --format mermaid: Include mermaid diagrams in documentation.
If --format json: Generate machine-readable JSON alongside markdown.

## Phase 4: Verification

- Verify all referenced files and modules actually exist
- Check that dependency relationships are bidirectionally consistent
- Validate entry points are reachable
- Compare with existing .moai/project/codemaps/ to highlight changes (if not --force)

## Phase 5: Report

Display completion summary in user's conversation_language:

- Files generated: List of created/updated codemaps
- Architecture highlights: Key patterns and notable findings
- Potential issues: Circular dependencies, orphaned modules, high coupling

Next Steps (AskUserQuestion):

- Write SPEC for improvements (Recommended): Create a SPEC to address any architectural issues found. Useful if circular dependencies or high coupling were detected.
- Generate project documentation: Run /moai project to create or update product.md, structure.md, tech.md alongside the new codemaps.
- Review codemaps manually: Open the generated files in .moai/project/codemaps/ directory for manual review and editing.

## Task Tracking

[HARD] Task management tools mandatory:
- Each map file creation tracked as a pending task via TaskCreate
- Before each generation: change to in_progress via TaskUpdate
- After each generation: change to completed via TaskUpdate

## Agent Chain Summary

- Phase 1: Explore subagent (codebase exploration, read-only) — the workflow's single Agent() spawn
- Phase 2-3: MoAI orchestrator (analysis and generation, orchestrator-direct from the Phase 1 exploration output + deterministic tooling)
- Phase 4: MoAI orchestrator (verification checks)

## Execution Summary

1. Parse arguments (extract flags: --force, --area, --format, --depth)
2. Check for existing .moai/project/codemaps/ directory content
3. Delegate codebase exploration to Explore subagent (the single Agent() spawn)
4. Perform architecture analysis and map generation orchestrator-direct (exploration output + deterministic tooling)
5. Verify generated maps for consistency
6. TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for all generated files
7. Report results with next step options
