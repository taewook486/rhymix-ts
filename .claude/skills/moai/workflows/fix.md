# Workflow: Fix - One-Shot Auto-Fix

Purpose: One-shot autonomous fix with parallel scanning and classification. AI finds issues, classifies by severity, applies safe fixes, and reports results.

Flow: Parallel Scan -> Classify -> Fix -> Verify -> Report

## Supported Flags

- --dry (alias --dry-run): Preview only, no changes applied
- --sequential (alias --seq): Sequential scan instead of parallel
- --level N: Maximum fix level to apply (default 3)
- --errors (alias --errors-only): Fix errors only, skip warnings
- --security (alias --include-security): Include security issues in scan
- --no-fmt (alias --no-format): Skip formatting fixes
- --resume [ID] (alias --resume-from): Resume from snapshot (latest if no ID)

## Pipeline Contract (Agentless Classification)

<!-- @MX:NOTE - Agentless fixed-pipeline classification; localize→repair→validate contract. See spec-workflow.md#subcommand-classification. -->

This subcommand is classified as **Agentless fixed-pipeline**.
It executes a deterministic 3-phase contract: **localize → repair → validate**.

- **Phase mapping**: localize ← Phase 1+2+2.5; repair ← Phase 4; validate ← Phase 4
- **No LLM-driven control flow**: Agent() invocations exist for executor delegation within phases (e.g., a per-spawn `Agent(general-purpose)` backend specialist for auto-fix, per `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/archived-agent-rejection.md` §C) but never select the next phase.
- **No-op exit**: When the localize phase finds zero targets, the pipeline exits with status `no-op` and exit code 0, skipping repair and validate.
- **Fail-fast**: When repair encounters an unresolvable error, the pipeline terminates and reports the error. There is no multi-agent fallback.
- **`--mode` flag handling**: Any `--mode` flag passed to this subcommand is ignored. The system logs `MODE_FLAG_IGNORED_FOR_UTILITY` at info level and proceeds with the fixed pipeline.
- **Repeatability**: Even when the parent invocation supplies `--mode loop`, the pipeline runs once per command invocation. Re-entry requires explicit user re-invocation.

See [Subcommand Classification matrix](../../rules/moai/workflow/spec-workflow.md#subcommand-classification) for the full pipeline-vs-multi-agent contract.

## Loop Taxonomy Position — goal engine + presets

The loop taxonomy is re-expressed as **goal engine + preset**: the quadrants are presets, not independent engines. `/moai fix` occupies the **turn-based** quadrant as the one-shot preset: one scan-fix-verify pass per invocation, no ceiling, no cadence (it does not arm the goal engine — that is the goal-based sweep preset's job).

- **How it starts**: a single `/moai fix` (or `/moai fix --ci`) invocation.
- **How it ends**: Phase 5 verification completes with claim/evidence rows — success, or residue persisted (§ Phase 8) plus a `/moai loop` recommendation.
- **When it fits**: a one-off diagnostic sweep or a quick CI-triggered patch, not driving toward a completion condition across many iterations.

Sibling presets (same **goal engine + preset** framing, different quadrant): **goal-based** iteration is `.claude/skills/moai/workflows/loop.md` (the project-wide sweep preset that arms the goal engine); **time-based** cadence recipes are `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/cadence-bridge.md`; **proactive** CI-triggered watch is the `moai-workflow-ci-loop` skill.

## Phase 1: Parallel Scan

Launch three diagnostic tools simultaneously using Bash with run_in_background for 3-4x speedup (8s vs 30s).

Scanner 1 - LSP Diagnostics:
Language-specific type checking via auto-detection. Indicator file determines language, then the corresponding LSP tool is executed:

| Language | Indicator File | LSP Command |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Go | go.mod | `go vet ./...` |
| Python | pyproject.toml / setup.py | `mypy --output json` |
| TypeScript | package.json (tsconfig.json present) | `tsc --noEmit` |
| JavaScript | package.json (no tsconfig.json) | `node --check` or skip |
| Rust | Cargo.toml | `cargo check --message-format json` |
| Java (Maven) | pom.xml | `mvn compile -q` |
| Java (Gradle) | build.gradle | `gradle compileJava -q` |
| Kotlin | build.gradle.kts | `gradle compileKotlin -q` |
| C# | *.csproj / *.sln | `dotnet build --no-restore -q` |
| Ruby | Gemfile | `bundle exec rubocop --format json` |
| PHP | composer.json | `php -l` on changed files |
| Scala | build.sbt | `sbt compile` |
| Elixir | mix.exs | `mix compile` |
| Swift | Package.swift | `swift build` |
| Flutter/Dart | pubspec.yaml | `dart analyze` |
| R | DESCRIPTION | `R CMD check --no-manual` |
| C++ | CMakeLists.txt | `cmake --build build --target all` |

Output: Parsed error list with file, line, column, severity, message for each diagnostic.

Scanner 2 - AST-grep Scan:
- Structural pattern matching with sgconfig.yml rules
- Security patterns and code quality rules

Scanner 3 - Linter:
Language-specific linting via auto-detection:

| Language | Linter Command |
|----------|---------------|
| Go | `golangci-lint run --out-format json` |
| Python | `ruff check --output-format json` |
| TypeScript/JavaScript | `eslint --format json` |
| Rust | `cargo clippy --message-format json` |
| Java | `checkstyle` (if configured) or skip |
| Kotlin | `detekt --output-format xml` (if configured) |
| C# | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` |
| Ruby | `bundle exec rubocop --format json` |
| PHP | `composer exec phpcs -- --report=json` (if configured) |
| Swift | `swiftlint lint --reporter json` (if configured) |
| Elixir | `mix credo --format json` |
| Flutter/Dart | `dart analyze` (covers linting) |
| Scala / R / C++ | Language-specific tool if configured, else skip |

If linter not installed or configured: Skip Scanner 3 and note absence in report.

After all scanners complete:
- Parse output from each tool into structured issue list
- Remove duplicate issues appearing in multiple scanners
- Sort by severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Group by file path for efficient fixing

**Structured Error Output (Language-Agnostic):**
Normalize all scanner output into a unified issue record format regardless of language:
- `file`: relative path from project root
- `line`: integer line number
- `column`: integer column number (0 if not available)
- `severity`: "error" | "warning" | "info"
- `code`: diagnostic code or rule name (if available)
- `message`: human-readable description
- `source`: "lsp" | "lint" | "ast-grep"
- `language`: detected project language

This normalization enables language-agnostic fix agents to work without language-specific logic.

Language auto-detection uses indicator files and covers all 16 MoAI-supported languages equally (C++, C#, Elixir, Flutter, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, TypeScript). Each language has its own marker files (for example `go.mod` for Go, `pyproject.toml` for Python, `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript, `Cargo.toml` for Rust, `pubspec.yaml` for Flutter); the scanner inspects project root and activates the corresponding toolchain. See `.claude/skills/moai/workflows/sync/quality-gates-quality.md` Step 0.6.1 for the complete Language Detection table.

Error handling: If any scanner fails, continue with results from successful scanners. Note the failed scanner in the report.

If --sequential flag: Run LSP, then AST-grep, then Linter sequentially.

## Phase 2: Classification

Issues classified into four levels:

- Level 1 (Immediate): No approval required. Examples: import sorting, whitespace, formatting
- Level 2 (Safe): Log only, no approval. Examples: rename variable, add type annotation
- Level 3 (Review): User approval required. Examples: logic changes, API modifications
- Level 4 (Manual): Auto-fix not allowed. Examples: security vulnerabilities, architecture changes

## Phase 3: Pre-Fix MX Context Scan

Before applying fixes, scan target files for existing @MX tags to understand context and constraints:

**Scan Target:** All files with classified issues (from Phase 2 results).

**MX Context Extraction:**
- @MX:ANCHOR functions: Flag as critical path. Pass fan_in context to fix agent. Warn that signature changes may break multiple callers.
- @MX:WARN zones: Pass danger context to fix agent. Ensure fix does not worsen the warned condition.
- @MX:NOTE context: Pass business logic context to fix agent to prevent fixing symptoms while breaking intent.
- @MX:TODO items: Check if any classified issues match existing TODOs (enables removal upon fix).

**Output:** MX context map passed to Phase 4 agents as part of the fix prompt. Each fix agent receives:
- List of @MX:ANCHOR functions in the target file (do not break these contracts)
- List of @MX:WARN zones (approach with caution)
- Relevant @MX:NOTE context (understand before modifying)

**Skip Condition:** If no @MX tags found in target files, proceed directly to Phase 3.

See .claude/rules/moai/workflow/mx-tag-protocol.md for tag type definitions.

## Phase 4: Auto-Fix

<!-- @MX:WARN @MX:REASON - Future PRs may be tempted to add LLM-driven Level-to-agent dispatch here. The current static lookup table (lines 175-179) MUST remain a fixed mapping. Any LLM-decided dispatch fails TestAgentlessUtilityNoLLMControlFlow. -->

[HARD] Agent delegation mandate (Level 2+): ALL Level 2 and above fix tasks MUST be delegated to specialized agents. NEVER execute Level 2+ fixes directly. Level 1 (import sorting, whitespace, formatting) is exempt: the orchestrator runs the language's deterministic formatter command directly (e.g., gofmt/goimports, ruff format, prettier, rustfmt) without an Agent() spawn — a formatter run needs no agent specialization.

Executor selection by fix level (static lookup table — domain expertise injected per-spawn per `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/archived-agent-rejection.md` §C):
- Level 1 (import, formatting): orchestrator-direct formatter command (no Agent() spawn)
- Level 2 (rename, type): manager-develop (cycle_type=ddd) or per-spawn `Agent(general-purpose)` refactoring specialist
- Level 3 (logic, API): manager-develop subagent (after user approval)

Execution order:
- Level 1 fixes applied automatically via the orchestrator-direct formatter command
- Level 2 fixes applied automatically via agent delegation, with logging
- Level 3 fixes require AskUserQuestion approval, then delegated to agent
- Level 4 fixes listed in report as manual action items

If --dry flag: Display preview of all classified issues and exit without changes.

## Phase 5: Verification

<!-- @MX:NOTE - Evidence-bearing verification per verification-claim-integrity.md §1.1: every PASS claim below MUST be backed by a re-executed scanner exit code and parsed count, not prose self-assessment. -->

Phase 5 verification MUST produce claim/evidence pairs, never prose self-assessment. Every claim in the fix report's verification section cites the exact command re-run and its parsed exit code / issue count, per `.claude/rules/moai/core/verification-claim-integrity.md` §1.1 (no unobserved verification claim) and §3 (5-section evidence format).

**Step 1 — Full re-scan (baseline-comparable regression guard):** Re-run the same three Phase 1 scanners (LSP, AST-grep, Linter) against the FULL target scope, not only the files Phase 4 modified — a regression can land in an untouched file or in an already-scanned file that had no prior issue.

**Step 2 — Diff against the Phase 1 baseline:** Compare the Phase 5 full-rescan issue list against the Phase 1 baseline issue list (parsed lists, not eyeballed) to derive three sets: Resolved (baseline-only), Persisting (both lists — targeted issue NOT fixed), and Regression (Phase-4-only — a NEW issue absent from the baseline).

**Step 3 — Regression handling:** Every issue in the Regression set MUST be either (a) reverted — undo the specific Phase-3 change that introduced it, then re-run Steps 1-2 to confirm it is gone — or (b) explicitly reported as failed in the fix report, naming the offending fix and the regression's file:line. Silent acceptance of a regression is prohibited; the fix run MUST NOT be reported as successful while an unreverted, unreported regression exists.

**Claim/Evidence table (required report format):**

| Claim | Verification command | Evidence (parsed) |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------|
| N targeted issues resolved | Phase-4 Step 1 re-run command | exit code + parsed count, diffed against Phase 1 baseline (Step 2) |
| 0 regressions | Phase-4 Step 1 re-run command | Regression set (Step 2) == empty |

## Phase 6: MX Tag Update

After fixes are verified, update @MX tags for modified files:

**Tag Actions by Fix Level:**
| Fix Level | MX Action |
|-----------|-----------|
| Level 1 (formatting) | No tag changes typically needed |
| Level 2 (rename, type) | Update @MX:NOTE if signature changed |
| Level 3 (logic, API) | Add @MX:NOTE for new logic, re-evaluate ANCHOR |
| Level 4 (manual) | Requires @MX:WARN with @MX:REASON if security-related |

**Specific Actions:**
- Bug fix applied: Remove corresponding @MX:TODO if exists
- New code introduced: Add appropriate @MX tags per protocol
- Function signature changed: Re-evaluate @MX:ANCHOR (fan_in may change)
- Complexity increased: Add @MX:WARN if cyclomatic complexity >= 15
- Dangerous pattern introduced: Add @MX:WARN with @MX:REASON

**MX Tag Report Generation:**
Generate MX_TAG_REPORT section in fix report:
```markdown
## MX Tag Report

### Tags Added (N)
- file:line: @MX:NOTE: [description]

### Tags Removed (N)
- file:line: @MX:TODO (resolved)

### Tags Updated (N)
- file:line: @MX:ANCHOR (fan_in updated)

### Attention Required
- Files with new @MX:WARN requiring review
```

See .claude/rules/moai/workflow/mx-tag-protocol.md for complete tag rules.

## Phase 7: Dead Code Cleanup (Optional)

After fixes are applied and verified, scan for dead code exposed by the fixes:

- Delegate to clean workflow (workflows/clean.md) for comprehensive dead code analysis
- Targets: Files modified during fix phase that may now have unused imports, orphaned functions, or unreferenced variables
- Skip condition: --errors flag was set (errors-only mode skips cleanup) or no dead code detected
- Clean workflow applies safe removal with test verification

## Phase 8: Residue Persistence and Escalation Recommendation

<!-- @MX:NOTE - One-shot residue handoff to the /moai loop persistence schema (see loop.md § Remaining-Issue Persistence). Extends exit_kind with "one-shot-residue" for this one-shot pipeline's exit path — the base ceiling|manual-residue enum stays owned by that schema's source. -->

**When** the fix workflow exits with residual issues — Level 4 manual items (Phase 4), unresolved errors, or a Phase 5 regression-guard failure (Step 3, an unreverted-and-reported regression) — the fix workflow persists the residue to `.moai/state/loop-verdict-<id>.json` using the schema `.claude/skills/moai/workflows/loop.md` § Remaining-Issue Persistence defines: `spec_or_scope`, `exit_kind`, `iterations_used`, `ceiling_applied` + its source, `conditions` final state, `remaining_issues[]`, `vci_report_ref`, `created_at`.

For this one-shot pipeline exit path, set `exit_kind: "one-shot-residue"` (a third value alongside the base `ceiling | manual-residue` enum) and `iterations_used: 1`.

When the fix report is generated with non-empty residue, the report recommends `/moai loop` entry for re-fixable residue (or manual action for Level 4 items) as a suggestion only — the fix workflow SHALL NOT auto-invoke `/moai loop` or any other subcommand. When the user does re-enter `/moai loop`, the persisted residue **enters the loop queue** as scanned queue items for the goal-preset sweep to drain (the loop's scan stage reads it as a queue supplier). The Pipeline Contract's Repeatability clause above governs re-entry; this recommendation is a suggestion surfaced in the report, not a mechanism that overrides it.

## Task Tracking

[HARD] Task management tools mandatory:
- All discovered issues added as pending via TaskCreate
- Before each fix: change to in_progress via TaskUpdate
- After each fix: change to completed via TaskUpdate

## Safe Development Protocol

All fixes follow CLAUDE.md Section 7 Safe Development Protocol:
- Reproduction-first: Write a failing test that reproduces the bug before fixing
- Approach-first: For Level 3+ fixes, explain approach before applying
- Post-fix review: List potential side effects after each fix

## Snapshot Save/Resume

Snapshot location: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.moai/cache/fix-snapshots/

Snapshot contents:
- Timestamp
- Target path
- Issues found, fixed, and pending counts
- Current fix level
- TODO state
- Scan results

Resume commands:
- /moai:fix --resume (uses latest snapshot)
- /moai:fix --resume fix-20260119-143052 (uses specific snapshot)

## Execution Summary

2. If --resume: Load snapshot and continue from saved state
3. Detect project language from indicator files
4. Execute parallel scan (LSP + AST-grep + Linter)
5. Aggregate results and remove duplicates
6. Classify into Levels 1-4
7. Scan target files for @MX tags (Phase 3: Pre-Fix MX Context Scan)
8. TaskCreate for all discovered issues
9. If --dry: Display preview and exit
10. Apply Level 1 fixes orchestrator-direct via the formatter command; apply Level 2 fixes via agent delegation (with MX context)
11. Request approval for Level 3 fixes via AskUserQuestion
12. Verify fixes by re-running diagnostics
13. Update @MX tags for modified files (Phase 6)
14. Save snapshot to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.moai/cache/fix-snapshots/
15. Report with evidence (file:line changes)
