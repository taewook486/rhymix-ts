Security & Constraints - Security policies, execution constraints, and Git workflow strategies.

Quick Access:
- Agent-First Mandate (Agent() only)
- Security Sandbox (protected paths, forbidden commands)
- Permission System (RBAC 4 levels)
- Git Strategy 3-Mode System (Manual/Personal/Team)
- TRUST 5 Quality Gates
- Compliance (GDPR, CCPA, OWASP, SOC 2, ISO 27001)

Use Cases:
- Security constraint enforcement
- Git workflow configuration
- Compliance validation
- Error handling protocols

---

## Usage Patterns

### Loading Individual Modules

```python
# Load specific module
from pathlib import Path

skill_path = Path(".claude/skills/moai-foundation-core")
module_path = skill_path / "modules" / "trust-5-framework.md"

with open(module_path) as f:
 content = f.read()
```

### Progressive Loading

```python
# Load progressively based on user needs
class ModuleLoader:
 def load_quick_reference(self, module_name: str):
 """Load Quick Reference section only (~1K tokens)."""
 content = self.load_module(module_name)
 return self.extract_section(content, "Quick Reference")
 
 def load_implementation(self, module_name: str):
 """Load Implementation Guide (~3K tokens)."""
 content = self.load_module(module_name)
 return self.extract_section(content, "Implementation Guide")
 
 def load_advanced(self, module_name: str):
 """Load Advanced Patterns (~5K tokens)."""
 content = self.load_module(module_name)
 return self.extract_section(content, "Advanced Implementation")
```

### Searching Across Modules

```python
class ModuleSearch:
 def search_topic(self, query: str) -> list:
 """Search for topic across all modules."""
 modules_dir = Path(".claude/skills/moai-foundation-core/modules")
 results = []
 
 for module_file in modules_dir.glob("*.md"):
 with open(module_file) as f:
 content = f.read()
 
 if query.lower() in content.lower():
 results.append({
 "module": module_file.stem,
 "matches": content.lower().count(query.lower())
 })
 
 return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x["matches"], reverse=True)

# Usage
searcher = ModuleSearch()
results = searcher.search_topic("security")
# Results: trust-5-framework (high), delegation-patterns (medium), etc.
```

## Integration with SKILL.md

The main SKILL.md file (351 lines, within 500-line limit) provides:
- Quick overview of all 6 principles
- Entry points to each module
- Cross-references for deep dives
- Works Well With integration

Cross-Reference Pattern:
```markdown
<!-- In SKILL.md -->
### 1. TRUST 5 Framework - Quality Assurance System

Quick overview...

Detailed Reference: [TRUST 5 Framework Module](modules/trust-5-framework.md)
```
