### Canonical 7-item example

The following 7 verification commands cover the standard read-only verification
batch for a typical run-phase completion. The orchestrator SHOULD invoke all 7
in parallel within a single response turn:

```bash
# 1. Full test suite (Go)
go test ./... > /tmp/moai-verify/1-go-test.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/1-go-test.log

# 2. Coverage report (per-package)
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./internal/<pkg>/... > /tmp/moai-verify/2-cover.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/2-cover.log

# 3. Subagent-boundary grep (sentinel C-HRA-008)
grep -rn 'AskUserQuestion\|mcp__askuser' internal/harness/ internal/hook/ | grep -v "_test.go" | grep -v "^[^:]*:[0-9]*:[ \t]*//" > /tmp/moai-verify/3-boundary.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/3-boundary.log

# 4. Sentinel key audit (build-tag, retired SPEC, etc.)
grep -rn 'FROZEN_SENTINEL\|HARNESS_FROZEN' internal/ | head -20 > /tmp/moai-verify/4-sentinel.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/4-sentinel.log

# 5. CLI smoke check (cmd/moai)
go run ./cmd/moai --version > /tmp/moai-verify/5-cli.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/5-cli.log

# 6. Benchmark micro-suite (optional)
go test -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$ ./internal/<pkg>/... > /tmp/moai-verify/6-bench.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/6-bench.log

# 7. Lint baseline (golangci-lint)
# Linter set + default timeout governed by root .golangci.yml; the --timeout=2m flag here overrides it for the quick-check budget.
golangci-lint run --timeout=2m > /tmp/moai-verify/7-lint.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 /tmp/moai-verify/7-lint.log
```

In Claude's response, all 7 commands are invoked as separate Bash tool calls
within the same assistant turn. The orchestrator does NOT issue them serially
across multiple turns.

### File-redirect contract

The canonical batch above also demonstrates the **file-redirect contract**: when a verification command's verbatim output exceeds the **bounded-tail ceiling** (concrete default: **≤50 lines OR ≤2KB, whichever is smaller**), the orchestrator redirects the verbatim output to a file on disk and surfaces only **exit code + bounded-tail summary** in conversation context. Each command above shows the redirected form (`> /tmp/moai-verify/<N>-<slug>.log 2>&1; echo "exit=$?"; tail -50 …`).

This contract governs *how* verification output is represented in context, NOT *whether* the commands run in parallel — the single-turn multi-Bash HARD obligation above is unchanged. The cited file path MUST appear in the Verification Matrix / Completion Report banner (`.claude/output-styles/moai/moai.md` §8) or in the manager-agent `§E` self-verification block, so the verbatim evidence remains reachable at audit time. This preserves `.claude/rules/moai/core/verification-claim-integrity.md` §1.1 **surface 1** (orchestrator self-report) and **surface 2** (manager-agent `§E` self-verification): every claim row remains attributable to a directly-observed command whose verbatim output is reachable at the cited file path.

The contract is **"verbatim evidence lives on disk with a citable path; context carries exit code + bounded tail"** — NOT **"drop the evidence"**. Inline quotation is PERMITTED when verbatim output is below the ceiling (the redirect obligation triggers only on exceedance); the diet removes the *double-burn* (Bash inline output + banner re-quote), not the evidence itself. The exact ceiling value and directory scheme are tunable per-domain; the contract holds regardless of the specific numbers.

### Evidence persistence obligation

The cited evidence path MUST remain reachable at audit time, including after `/tmp` directory clearance. `/tmp` is OS-cleared periodically (macOS reboot, Linux tmpfs re-mount, systemd-tmpfiles); a cited path that no longer resolves to a file violates `verification-claim-integrity.md` §1.1 surface 1 (orchestrator self-report) and surface 2 (manager-agent §E self-verification) — every claim row MUST remain attributable to a directly-observed command whose verbatim output is reachable at the cited file path.

To satisfy this reachability obligation, evidence SHALL be persisted under `.moai/state/verify/<session>/` (gitignored runtime state, same directory family as `context-usage.json` and `active-sessions.json`). The exact persist mechanism — direct write to `.moai/state/verify/<session>/`, or `/tmp` write followed by a copy step — is a run-phase implementation detail; the contract states the OBLIGATION (evidence survives `/tmp` clearance), not the mechanism. **"Persist evidence" ≠ "drop evidence"**: the diet removes the *double-burn* (inline output + banner re-quote), NOT the evidence itself. The verbatim output MUST remain on disk at a citable, audit-time-reachable path.

### Anti-pattern: serial verification across turns

```
Turn 1: go test ./...     → wait for completion → Turn 1 ends
Turn 2: golangci-lint ... → wait for completion → Turn 2 ends
Turn 3: grep -rn ...      → wait for completion → Turn 3 ends
```

This pattern locks the orchestrator into N sequential turns where 1 turn would
suffice. Each turn adds round-trip latency. For 7 verifications averaging 2 s
each, serial execution adds ~14 s of dead-time per run-phase completion.

### When to use serial execution

- Commands that depend on each other (e.g., `make build` before `go test ./...`)
- Commands that write to the same file or directory
- Commands that mutate shared state (filesystem, env vars)

### Cross-reference

- The canonical verification-batch acceptance criterion (recorded in the
  predecessor workflow optimization rule) verifies this section contains the
  7 verification keywords (`go test`, `coverprofile`, `grep `, `sentinel`,
  `cmd/moai`, `bench`, `lint`).
- `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/verification-batch-pattern.md` documents the
  formal verification grouping pattern.

## Tool Optimization Patterns

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] Agents MUST use single-command idioms over multi-step
shell pipelines when a CLI tool provides structured output (JSON). The
canonical patterns below replace the prose alternatives that previously
expanded into multiple sequential commands.

### CI Status Query

```bash
# Canonical pattern — single command, structured JSON output.
gh pr checks <PR> --json name,state,conclusion | jq '.[] | select(.conclusion != "SUCCESS")'

# Why: single round-trip, parseable, easier to integrate with subsequent steps.
# Avoid: gh pr checks <PR> | grep -E 'FAIL|PENDING'  (string parsing, brittle)
```

#### Waiting for checks to finish — `--watch`, run in the background

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] The query above **samples** CI once. When the orchestrator instead needs to **wait** for checks to reach a terminal state, it MUST use `gh pr checks --watch`, and it MUST issue that command in the Bash tool's background mode. A hand-rolled `sleep`-and-poll loop is prohibited.

```bash
# Canonical wait pattern — issue with the Bash tool's background mode.
gh pr checks <PR> --watch --fail-fast
```

- `--watch` blocks until every check is terminal, so no polling interval has to be chosen or tuned.
- `--fail-fast` returns non-zero the moment any check fails, so the **exit code alone is the verdict** — no output parsing is needed to decide pass/fail.
- Background mode keeps the turn unblocked: the orchestrator continues independent read-only work and is re-invoked when the watch exits.

A manual polling loop burns one turn per iteration, hard-codes an interval that is simultaneously too slow for fast checks and too fast for slow ones, and re-implements — less reliably — a wait the CLI already provides. It also holds the turn open for the full CI duration, which the background `--watch` does not.

```bash
# Anti-pattern — manual polling re-implements --watch and burns a turn per iteration
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do sleep 60; gh pr checks <PR>; done
```

### Recent Commit Inspection

```bash
# Canonical pattern — single command, structured.
git log --format='%h %s %ci' -10 | head -10

# Why: built-in format string avoids multi-step git log | awk pipelines.
# Avoid: git log --pretty=oneline | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git show
```

### ToolSearch Per-Turn Preload

```
ToolSearch(query: "select:AskUserQuestion,TaskCreate,TaskUpdate,TaskList,TaskGet", max_results: 5)
```

This canonical preload SHOULD be invoked at the start of every orchestrator
turn where deferred tools may be needed. See
`.claude/rules/moai/core/askuser-protocol.md` for the full preload contract.

### Cross-reference

- The canonical CI-status-query acceptance criterion (recorded in the
  predecessor workflow optimization rule) verifies this section contains
  `gh pr checks --json` and `jq` literals in proximity.
- `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/cache-aware-execution.md` — prompt-cache-aware
  ordering (stagger-spawn for parallel same-type agents, gate placement,
  session-loaded file edit timing).

## Pre-Edit Sync Check — rationale and enforcement record

> Relocated verbatim from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Pre-Edit Sync Check (Direct-Edit Race Mitigation) to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The binding gate (TRIGGER / CHECK / DECIDE / RE-CHECK) and the sweep prohibition remain inline there; this section carries the incident record, the failure analysis of the previous version, and the enforcement-placement assessment.

### Incident record (why the rule is binding)

In the recorded incident, five Claude sessions worked the same shared primary checkout simultaneously. 104 uncommitted files accumulated there; **73 of them existed on no branch at all** and had to be rescued into a pull request by hand. The destructive mechanism is ordinary: a concurrent `git add -A && commit` in one session sweeps another session's uncommitted work into a commit that was never meant to carry it; a branch switch or stash strands it outright. A rule without the incident attached gets skipped; this one has the receipts.

### Why the previous version of this check failed

Two distinct failure modes — they need different fixes:

1. **Nothing executed it.** The check was procedural prose in this rule file. No hook fires it, no tool result reminds the agent of it, and a "run three probes before your first edit" instruction competes with task momentum — and loses. This was the dominant failure in the recorded incident: the procedure was directionally correct and was simply never run.
2. **It sampled at the wrong moment.** Even perfectly executed, a once-per-task check cannot see a session that starts mid-task, and the destruction mechanism is not the edit — it is the OTHER session's `git add -A` at commit time. The previous text placed all discipline on the editor and none on the sweeper.

The rewrite addresses both: the decision procedure is compressed into a moment-of-edit gate an agent can actually run, and a sweep prohibition binds the commit-side primitive that does the damage.

### Enforcement assessment — why there is no PreToolUse-on-Edit/Write advisory hook

A per-edit advisory hook was considered and declined:

- **Measured cost**: the branch-guard PreToolUse hook — the closest comparable, it spawns git subprocesses — averages 135-256ms per invocation. `Edit`/`Write` is the most frequent mutation in a coding session; a per-edit advisory multiplies that tax across every edit of every concurrent session — the exact multi-session load pattern that pushed the box over during the incident day.
- **Wrong sampling rate**: the probe's answer changes on the scale of minutes (sessions start and stop), not edits. Paying per-edit for a per-task answer taxes the wrong frequency.
- **Wrong target**: the edit is not the destructive primitive; the sweep is. If mechanical enforcement is ever wanted, the cheap and mechanism-adjacent placement is the commit-time Bash surface — extend the branch-guard hook family to warn on `git add -A` / `git add .` / `git commit -a` in the primary checkout (rare, once per task) — not on every Edit/Write.
- **Detection is already ambient**: the SessionStart signal carries foreign-session awareness to every session at zero per-edit cost; the procedure is the decision layer on top of it.

If a per-edit nudge is ever re-proposed, the only defensible variant is stateful: fire the probe on the FIRST `Edit`/`Write` of a session (or serve it from a short-TTL cache), never per edit.

## Pre-Spawn Sync Check rationale and incident record

> Relocated verbatim from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Pre-Spawn Sync Check to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The binding gate (the 2-command batch + active-sessions query), the interpretation matrices, and the read-only exemption remain inline there.

Rationale: when 2+ Claude Code sessions operate on the same project root + same memory hash (`~/.claude/projects/{hash}/memory/`), they may both consume the same paste-ready resume and attempt the same `/moai <subcommand>` work. The git working tree is shared; the memory file is shared. Without a pre-spawn fetch, the second session works on a stale baseline and may produce duplicate commits, conflicting frontmatter edits, or CHANGELOG entry races.

Origin: an earlier sync-phase race incident — a parallel session committed a spec.md frontmatter status update between manager-develop's final run-phase commit and manager-docs' sync commit. Detection occurred retrospectively when `git push` succeeded with an unexpected intermediate commit in the push range. The parallel-session-race-during-long-agent-runs lesson was reinforced and a pre-spawn-fetch-discipline lesson added.

## Hook Invocation Surface detail

> Relocated from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Hook Invocation Surface to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The compact 3-row table (script / trigger / exit-code semantics) and the orchestrator translation responsibility remain inline there.

Full per-row owning-policy detail (the compact inline table drops the Owning REQ column):

| Hook script | Owning REQ |
|-------------|------------|
| `.claude/hooks/moai/status-transition-ownership.sh` | Status Transition Ownership Matrix per `.claude/rules/moai/development/spec-frontmatter-schema.md` |
| `.claude/hooks/moai/sync-phase-quality-gate.sh` | sync-phase quality gate policy (lint + test + coverage delta) + dependency manifest audit on `go.mod` / `package-lock.json` / etc. changes |
| `.claude/hooks/moai/team-ac-verify.sh` | per-AC PASS evidence file verification (per the canonical team activation policy) |

Cell-level semantics the compact table summarizes:

- `status-transition-ownership.sh` — exit 0 always (advisory); the transition site is audit-logged to `.moai/logs/status-transition-audit.log`; exit-2 blocking is reserved for future ownership-mismatch enforcement.
- `sync-phase-quality-gate.sh` — exit 0 always; a failing check emits an advisory `systemMessage`; blocking mode (opt-in via `MOAI_SYNC_GATE_BLOCKING=1`) emits stdout JSON `{"decision":"block"}`.
- `team-ac-verify.sh` — exit 0 always; the reject decision MUST ride the exit-0 stdout channel because `decision` is documented only for PostToolUse/Stop/SubagentStop/UserPromptSubmit/ConfigChange/PreCompact/PostToolBatch — NOT TaskCompleted (the official TaskCompleted reject contract is `continue:false` + `stopReason`). The reject-path trigger itself is a minimal stub; full AC-verification logic is deferred to a follow-up SPEC.

Hook subagent boundary acceptance criterion:

```bash
grep -rn 'AskUserQuestion\|mcp__askuser' .claude/hooks/moai/ \
  | grep -v "^[^:]*:[0-9]*:[ \t]*#"
# Expected: no matches (hook scripts do not invoke AskUserQuestion)
```

## Ledger Closure clause bodies

> Relocated verbatim from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Ledger Closure to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The invariant, the [HARD] four-clause summary, and the scope-boundary note remain inline there.

The persistence-layer analogue is `session-handoff.md` Block 3-4 preconditions; the subsection codifies the in-session interrupt case (no `/clear`), the orchestration-layer analogue of the model-API rule that every `tool_use` receives a `tool_result`. Externally grounded in `github.com/wquguru/harness-books` book1 ch04 "账本闭环": whenever the system has promised an execution externally, it must close the ledger on interrupt.

- **(a) Synthetic result on aborted Agent() delegation.** When an `Agent()` delegation is aborted — user interrupt (Ctrl+C), parent-abort propagation (the orchestrator's own turn was aborted and the sub-agent was killed), or timeout (no return before a wall-clock or token-budget ceiling) — the orchestrator SHALL emit a **synthetic ledger-closing artifact** into its own context before issuing the next delegation. The artifact is a short prose summary (NOT a structured data record; no JSON schema, no `.moai/state/ledger.json`), naming what was delegated, that it did not return, and the abort reason if known. Its purpose is to close the open promise so the next turn does not proceed as if the delegation returned cleanly. This clause does NOT change the "Missing Inputs" blocker-report pattern: a blocker report is a *return*, not an *abort*; this clause covers only the case where no return is produced at all.
- **(b) team-ac-verify.sh reject-path `ledger_note` field.** When `.claude/hooks/moai/team-ac-verify.sh` rejects a `TaskCompleted`, it signals the rejection via stdout JSON `{"continue":false,"stopReason":"AC verification failed: ...","ledger_note":"..."}` and exits 0 — per Claude Code hook semantics, stdout JSON is honored only on exit 0 (on exit 2 stdout is discarded and only stderr is surfaced), so the reject decision and its `ledger_note` MUST ride the exit-0 stdout channel. The orchestrator injects this `ledger_note` as the ledger-closing artifact for that task.
- **(c) TeammateIdle exit-2 task closure.** When the TeammateIdle hook rejects a task's completion via exit-2 ("keep working"), the rejected task's TaskList entry MUST NOT be left in an open state without a reassignment owner. The orchestrator re-assigns the task (spawn a new teammate, re-delegate to the same teammate with a refined prompt, or close it as obsolete with a synthetic closing note). This binds the orchestrator's TaskList hygiene, not the hook's exit-2 emission. The parent-abort propagation that book1 ch07 names — cleanup handlers registered to avoid orphan tasks — is the source for this clause.
- **(d) Cross-references.** book1 ch04 (账本闭环 — the ledger-closure invariant); book1 ch07 (parent-abort propagates to forked children; agents are observable lifecycle objects via SubagentStart/SubagentStop hooks, exit-code-2 stderr feedback); `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/session-handoff.md` Block 3-4 preconditions (the persistence-layer analogue across `/clear`); and the ledger-closing artifact's truthfulness bound — `.claude/rules/moai/core/verification-claim-integrity.md` §1.1 surface 1 (orchestrator self-report): the artifact MUST be a real summary, not a fabricated "success".

## Per-Spawn Model Injection rationale

> Relocated from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Per-Spawn Model Injection to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The [HARD] rule and the four operative bullets remain inline there.

Omitting the `model` argument is not neutral. Nearly every agent definition carries `model: inherit`, so a spawn without an explicit model silently runs the agent on the parent session's model rather than its profiled one. The profile is still computed — nothing reports that it was never applied, which is why the rule is stated in the always-loaded file rather than left to the detailed policy file that only loads while agent files are being edited.

Full profile matrix, precedence order, and channel table: `.claude/rules/moai/development/model-policy.md`.

## Background Agent Execution rationale

> Relocated from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Background Agent Execution to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The [HARD] default alignment and the four spawning rules remain inline there.

The retained safeguard is **concurrency, not backgrounding**: MoAI does not run two write-capable agents concurrently, and orchestrator work performed concurrently with a write-capable agent is **read-only**. This binds specifically to the parallel write workers within a hierarchical team shape (e.g., `manager-lead` fan-out) — the orchestrator (or `manager-lead`) sequences write-capable leaf workers rather than running them concurrently, so a file-write race between agents is structurally prevented. The earlier blanket ban on background Write/Edit had its stated basis (background writes auto-denied) removed by v2.1.186 and no longer describes the runtime.

## Error Recovery retry-safety detail

> Relocated from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Error Recovery Pattern to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The 4-step pattern and the asymmetric-retry summary remain inline there.

- **Idempotent / read-only calls** (re-reading a file, re-running a search or query, re-running an initializer, fetching a URL) may be retried up to the ceiling — repeating them produces the same observable result, so a transient failure (a file lock, a network blip) is legitimately recovered by a retry.
- **Side-effecting calls** (writing/editing a file, committing, pushing, opening a pull request, deploying, mutating external-API state) carry a duplicate-effect hazard. When a side-effecting call fails *ambiguously* — the failure signal is present but whether the effect already landed is uncertain — first **observe the current state** to determine whether the effect already occurred, and retry only when the effect is confirmed absent. Retrying without first observing state risks a duplicate commit, a duplicate pull request, or a double deploy. The absence of a success signal is not evidence the effect did not land.

This refines the inline step 3 ("do not retry the identical call") along the side-effect axis: for a side-effecting call, "try an alternative approach" begins with observing whether the effect already occurred.

## Attributable diff-check detail

> Relocated from `agent-common-protocol.md` § Parallel Execution → Attributable diff-check doctrinal switch to keep the always-loaded file within its size budget. The switch rule, the three match conditions, the four mismatch names, and the never-silent-skip boundary remain inline there (SPEC-SYNC-PARALLEL-DOCS-001 A9).

The switch consults the shared diagnostic snapshot via `moai verify check --key-current` (the live snapshot surface wired at `.claude/skills/moai/workflows/sync/quality-gates-quality.md` Step 0.5.2, keyed by HEAD SHA) BEFORE re-executing; on all-three attribution match, it consumes the attributable §E evidence (`.claude/rules/moai/development/manager-develop-prompt-template.md` § Section E → attribution discipline clause) for that dimension INSTEAD of re-executing the corresponding command. This is a composition-time doctrinal switch — no mechanical "about to re-run command X" preamble token exists to intercept (the batch is orchestrator-composed single-turn multi-Bash; re-execution is implicit Bash); it binds the orchestrator's batch-composition discipline, not a runtime hook.

On all-three match (the default path), the batch records the snapshot key + cited §E evidence path as its baseline-attribution per VCI §2 and DOES NOT re-execute the corresponding command (test / lint / vet / cover). The verification dimension is marked PASS-attributed, not PASS-reexecuted — both satisfy VCI §1.1, but the attribution path is faster and the re-execution path is stronger.

On ANY mismatch (`snapshot_key_drift` / `command_drift` / `missing_section_e` / `output_drift`), the batch SHALL fall back to re-execution of the affected verification dimension — any-mismatch → re-execute, never silent skip. The fallback is logged with the mismatch reason; the batch NEVER silently skips verification — the VCI §1.1 invariant holds on every path. Full pattern: `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/verification-batch-pattern.md` § Attributable diff-check pattern.
