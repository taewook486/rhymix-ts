# Worktree Integration Guide

Integration guide for MoAI Worktree and Claude Code Native Worktree systems.

## Overview

MoAI-ADK supports two complementary worktree systems for isolated development:

**Claude Code Native Worktree** (`.claude/worktrees/`):
- Ephemeral, session-scoped isolation
- Automatic cleanup when session ends
- Used for subagent isolation via `isolation: worktree` in agent definitions (v2.1.49+)
- CLI access: `claude --worktree` or `claude -w` (user-level flag)

**MoAI Worktree** (`~/.moai/worktrees/{ProjectName}/`):
- Persistent, SPEC-scoped workspaces in global home directory
- Managed via `moai worktree` CLI commands
- Used for multi-session SPEC development and team collaboration

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Claude Native | MoAI |
|---------|--------------|------|
| **Path** | `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` | `~/.moai/worktrees/{Project}/{SPEC}/` |
| **Lifetime** | Ephemeral (session-scoped) | Persistent |
| **Purpose** | Session isolation for subagents | SPEC development, PR creation |
| **CLI** | `claude -w` (user) or `isolation: worktree` (agent) | `moai worktree new/list/remove` |
| **Cleanup** | Automatic on session end | Manual via `moai worktree remove` |
| **Branch Strategy** | Temporary branches | Feature branches linked to SPEC |
| **Team Use** | Single agent isolation | Multi-developer collaboration |
| **State Persistence** | None | SPEC state, progress tracking |
| **Hook Support** | WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks | WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove hooks |

## Terminology Glossary

This glossary is the canonical definition surface for the L1 / L2 / L3 worktree-layer terms used across the MoAI rule set. Other rules (`spec-workflow.md`, `worktree-state-guard.md`, `session-handoff.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` §14) cross-reference `§ Terminology Glossary` for these definitions.

| Layer | Name | What it is | Path / Trigger | Lifetime | Owner |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| **L1** | Claude-native ephemeral worktree | Session-scoped isolation materialized by the Claude Code runtime for a subagent spawned with `Agent(isolation: "worktree")` (or `claude --worktree`). The runtime decides whether to materialize it. | `.claude/worktrees/<auto-name>/` | Ephemeral — auto-cleaned on session end | Claude Code runtime (autonomous; MoAI orchestrator does not mandate it per the opt-in policy) |
| **L2** | MoAI persistent SPEC worktree | A persistent, SPEC-scoped working directory created by `moai worktree new SPEC-XXX`. Used for multi-session SPEC development (run + sync phases reuse the same L2 worktree). | `~/.moai/worktrees/<project>/<SPEC>/` | Persistent — disposed only via `moai worktree done SPEC-XXX` after both run + sync PRs merge | MoAI (user-managed via `moai worktree` CLI) |
| **L3** | Worktree launch action (opt-in) | The user opt-in launch step that creates an L2 worktree, e.g. `/moai plan --worktree`. L3 is the *action*; L2 is the *artifact* it produces. Per the opt-in policy, L3 is opt-in; the default flow runs all phases on a `feat/SPEC-XXX` branch in the main checkout. | `/moai plan --worktree` (or `moai worktree new --worktree`) | n/a (an action, not a directory) | User (explicit opt-in) |

Relationships:
- An **L3** launch action (`--worktree`) creates an **L2** persistent SPEC worktree.
- An **L1** ephemeral worktree is materialized autonomously by the Claude Code runtime for an isolated subagent; it is independent of L2/L3 and may occur inside either the main checkout or an L2 worktree.
- When L3 was used, the paste-ready resume MUST anchor the next session inside the L2 worktree (Block 0) per `session-handoff.md` § Worktree-Anchored Resume Pattern.

## Claude Code 2.1.50+ Worktree Features

### `claude --worktree` (`-w`) Flag

For users starting isolated sessions:

```bash
# Start new isolated session in worktree
claude --worktree

# With custom name
claude --worktree my-feature

# With tmux for split-pane display (tmux or iTerm2 required)
claude --worktree --tmux
```

Behavior:
- Creates `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` automatically
- Branches from default remote branch
- On session end: prompts to keep (with commits) or auto-deletes (no changes)

tmux flag notes:
- Requires tmux or iTerm2
- NOT supported in VS Code integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty
- Useful for parallel team mode where viewing multiple teammates' output is beneficial

### `isolation: worktree` in Agent Frontmatter

For agents that need isolated execution (v2.1.49+):

```yaml
---
name: my-implementer
isolation: worktree   # Agent runs in its own isolated worktree
background: true      # Agent runs without blocking main conversation
---
```

When to use `isolation: worktree`:
- Implementation teammates that write files (role_profiles: implementer, tester, designer)
- Prevents file conflicts between parallel teammates
- Each agent gets its own clean worktree at `.claude/worktrees/<auto-name>/`

When NOT to use `isolation: worktree`:
- Read-only teammates (role_profiles: researcher, analyst, reviewer)
- `permissionMode: plan` already prevents writes; adding isolation adds overhead without benefit

### `background: true` in Agent Frontmatter

Run agent without blocking the main conversation (v2.1.46+):

```yaml
---
name: team-coder
background: true   # Returns immediately; results delivered on next turn
---
```

Use with `isolation: worktree` for optimal parallel execution in team mode.

Background-execution policy for write-capable agents is owned by `.claude/rules/moai/core/agent-common-protocol.md` § Background Agent Execution. As of Claude Code v2.1.198 subagents run in the background by default, and a background write surfaces a permission prompt in the main session naming the asking subagent; MoAI aligns with that runtime default rather than forcing foreground. The retained safeguard is concurrency, not backgrounding: MoAI does not run two write-capable agents concurrently. Use `background: true` for:
- Read-only research and analysis agents
- Agents whose write paths are pre-approved in settings.json `permissions.allow`

Kill background agent: Press `Ctrl+X Ctrl+K` in Claude Code interface (v2.1.83+).

### Worktree Base Branch (`worktree.baseRef`)

Native worktrees (`--worktree` and subagent `isolation: worktree`) branch from the repository's default branch (`origin/HEAD`) by default, so they start from a clean tree matching the remote. If no remote is configured or the fetch fails, the worktree falls back to the current local `HEAD`. To always branch from local `HEAD` instead (carrying unpushed commits and feature-branch state), set `worktree.baseRef` to `"head"` in settings (accepts only `"fresh"` or `"head"`, not arbitrary refs):

```json
{
  "worktree": {
    "baseRef": "head"
  }
}
```

Use `"head"` when isolating subagents that must operate on in-progress work. To branch a native worktree from a specific pull request, pass the PR number prefixed with `#` (e.g. `claude --worktree "#1234"`); Claude Code fetches `pull/<number>/head` and creates the worktree at `.claude/worktrees/pr-<number>`.

This setting governs **Claude-native** worktrees only. MoAI's own `moai worktree new` uses the Branch Origin Decision Protocol (`origin/main` default; see `.claude/rules/moai/development/branch-origin-protocol.md`) and is unaffected by `worktree.baseRef`.

### `.worktreeinclude` (Copy Gitignored Files into Native Worktrees)

A native worktree is a fresh checkout, so untracked files (`.env`, `.env.local`, local config) are not present. Add a `.worktreeinclude` file at the project root to copy them automatically when Claude creates a worktree. It uses `.gitignore` syntax; only files that match a pattern AND are gitignored are copied (tracked files are never duplicated):

```text
.env
.env.local
.moai/config/sections/*.local.yaml
```

Applies to `--worktree`, subagent `isolation: worktree` worktrees, and desktop parallel sessions. NOT processed when a custom `WorktreeCreate` hook replaces the default git behavior — copy local files inside the hook script instead.

### `EnterWorktree` / `ExitWorktree` Tools

Claude can move the session into a worktree mid-session via the `EnterWorktree` tool (e.g. when the user says "work in a worktree"), creating one under `.claude/worktrees/`. Once inside, Claude can switch directly to another worktree by calling `EnterWorktree` with a target path; the previous worktree stays on disk untouched. `ExitWorktree` returns to the originating checkout. These are Claude Code runtime tools — MoAI does not mandate their use; they are the interactive counterpart to the `--worktree` launch flag and `isolation: worktree` frontmatter.

## Worktree Selection Rules [ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD]

### Decision Tree

```
Is this a team mode implementation with parallel agents?
  YES → Use Agent(isolation: "worktree") for write agents
        Do NOT use isolation for read-only agents
  NO ↓

Is this a multi-session SPEC development?
  YES → Use MoAI Worktree (moai worktree new SPEC-XXX)
  NO ↓

Is this a user-initiated parallel session?
  YES → Use claude --worktree (-w)
  NO ↓

Is this a one-shot sub-agent task?
  YES → Use Agent(isolation: "worktree") if agent writes files
        Use Agent() without isolation if agent is read-only
  NO → No worktree needed
```

### HARD Rules

- [ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] Implementation teammates in team mode (role_profiles: implementer, tester, designer) MUST use `isolation: "worktree"` when spawned via Agent()
- [ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] Read-only teammates (role_profiles: researcher, analyst, reviewer) MUST NOT use `isolation: "worktree"` — their `mode: "plan"` already prevents writes
- [ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] One-shot sub-agents that write files across 3 or more paths per invocation MUST use `isolation: "worktree"`. This includes write-heavy retained agents (manager-develop), per-spawn `Agent(general-purpose)` specialists with a write-heavy domain whitelist (e.g. backend / frontend / devops / refactoring), and team-mode role profiles (implementer, tester, designer).
<!-- @MX:ANCHOR: WorktreeMUSTRule — invariant contract; all write-heavy agents MUST declare isolation:worktree; enforced by LR-05 lint rule -->
<!-- @MX:REASON: MUST level required to eliminate silent file-write conflict failure mode in parallel Agent() execution. -->
- [ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] GitHub workflow agents (fixer agents in /moai github issues) MUST use `isolation: "worktree"` for branch isolation

## Sentinel Key Glossary

Structured error codes emitted by `moai agent lint` and `moai workflow lint` for programmatic detection:

| Sentinel Key | Source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ORC_WORKTREE_MISSING` | LR-05 (agent lint) | Write-heavy agent lacks `isolation: worktree` in frontmatter |
| `ORC_WORKTREE_ON_READONLY` | LR-09 (agent lint) | Read-only agent (`permissionMode: plan`) has `isolation: worktree` — prohibited overhead |
| `ORC_WORKTREE_REQUIRED` | `moai workflow lint` | `workflow.yaml` role_profiles entry for implementer/tester/designer has incorrect isolation value |

### When to Use Which

### Use `claude --worktree` (`-w`) for:

- **User-initiated isolation**: Starting a fresh session for exploratory work
- **Parallel sessions**: Running multiple independent Claude sessions on same repo
- **Quick experiments**: Testing code changes without affecting main workspace

### Use `Agent(isolation: "worktree")` for:

- **Parallel team agents**: Multiple implementation teammates working simultaneously
- **File conflict prevention**: Agents that write to different file patterns
- **One-shot sub-agents**: Sub-agents making cross-file modifications
- **GitHub issue fixing**: Each issue gets isolated worktree for branch safety

### Use MoAI Worktree (`moai worktree`) for:

- **SPEC implementation**: Multi-session development of a feature
- **PR development**: Complete feature branches with commits
- **Persistent workspaces**: Work that spans multiple Claude sessions

## Integration Pattern (Hybrid Approach)

The recommended workflow combines both worktree systems:

```
PLAN PHASE
  Claude Native (-w): Quick exploration, ephemeral, no persistence
  Team researchers: No worktree (read-only, permissionMode: plan)

RUN PHASE
  MoAI Worktree: SPEC implementation, persistent state
  Team write agents: Agent(isolation: "worktree") for parallel execution
  Team read agents: No worktree (quality validation, analysis)

SYNC PHASE
  MoAI Worktree: PR creation from persistent workspace
```

## Agent Configuration by Role

### Implementation Agents (isolation: worktree + background: true)

```yaml
# Implementation teammates (role_profiles: implementer, tester, designer)
# Spawned via: Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", mode: "acceptEdits", isolation: "worktree")
isolation: worktree   # Isolated worktree per agent
background: true      # Non-blocking parallel execution
permissionMode: acceptEdits
```

### Research/Analysis Agents (no isolation needed)

```yaml
# Read-only teammates (role_profiles: researcher, analyst, reviewer)
# Spawned via: Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", mode: "plan")
# No isolation: worktree (read-only, mode: plan prevents writes)
permissionMode: plan  # Read-only mode already provides safety
```

## WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove Hooks (Not Registered by Default)

Claude Code v2.1.49+ defines `WorktreeCreate` / `WorktreeRemove` hooks that **replace** Claude Code's default git worktree behavior — not extend it. Per the official contract (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks):

| Hook | Role | stdout contract | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| WorktreeCreate | Active creator — MUST actually create the worktree directory and echo its absolute path to stdout (plain text only, no JSON; HTTP hooks use `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"worktreePath": "..."}}`). | Single line: `/absolute/path/to/worktree` | Empty stdout OR any non-zero exit aborts creation |
| WorktreeRemove | Observer — runs during/after removal for cleanup. | No output required | Failures logged in debug mode only |

The stdin JSON for both events includes `worktree_path` (Claude Code's proposed path), `name`, `cwd`, `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `hook_event_name`.

**MoAI-ADK does NOT register these hooks by default.** Claude Code's default git worktree handling is sufficient for our agent isolation use case — write-heavy work is declared `isolation: worktree` by the retained `manager-develop` agent, by per-spawn `Agent(general-purpose)` specialists with a write-heavy domain whitelist, and by team-mode role profiles (implementer, tester, designer) per the Worktree Selection Rules above. Registering observer-only hooks here would replace the default behavior with non-functional stubs and produce `"WorktreeCreate hook returned a path that is not a directory: {}"` because an empty JSON object cannot be parsed as a path.

If a future use case requires custom worktree creation (e.g., non-git VCS, shared-file symlinks, per-worktree database setup), implement an active creator hook that:

1. Reads stdin JSON (fields: `worktree_path`, `name`, `cwd`, `session_id`).
2. Performs `git worktree add` (or equivalent for the VCS), redirecting its stdout to `/dev/null` so it does not pollute the hook stdout.
3. Prints **only** the absolute worktree path to stdout. All progress/diagnostic output goes to stderr.
4. Exits 0 on success; any non-zero exit aborts creation.

Handler files at `internal/hook/worktree_{create,remove}.go` and `internal/cli/hook.go` `worktree-create` / `worktree-remove` subcommands are preserved as opt-in infrastructure for future active-creator implementations. They are not registered in `.claude/settings.json` until such an implementation lands. Likewise, `.claude/hooks/moai/handle-worktree-{create,remove}.sh` wrapper scripts exist but are not invoked by any settings.json entry.

## Prompt Path Rules for Worktree-Isolated Agents

When the orchestrator generates prompts for agents spawned with `isolation: "worktree"`, paths in the prompt determine where the agent operates. Incorrect paths bypass worktree isolation entirely.

### HARD Rules

- [ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] Do NOT include absolute paths to the main project directory in agent prompts for write-target files
- [ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] Do NOT include `cd /absolute/project/path &&` in Bash commands within agent prompts
- [ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] Reference write-target files by project-root-relative paths (e.g., `src/domains/auth/handler.go`) and let the agent resolve from its own CWD
- [ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` in hook commands is acceptable — Claude Code resolves this to the correct directory for the agent's context

### Path Categories

| Category | Example | Absolute Path OK? | Reason |
|----------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| Write-target files | Source code, tests | NO — use relative | Agent CWD is worktree root; relative paths resolve correctly |
| Read-only references | Skills, configs via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` | YES | Content is identical in main repo; read-only access is safe |
| SPEC documents | `.moai/specs/SPEC-XXX/spec.md` | Relative preferred | SPEC files are copied to worktree during checkout |
| Bash commands | `go test ./...` | NO `cd` prefix | Agent CWD is already set to worktree root |

### How It Works

When `isolation: "worktree"` is set, Claude Code:
1. Creates a temporary worktree from the current branch
2. Sets the agent's CWD to the worktree root
3. The agent constructs absolute paths from its own CWD

```
Main repo:  $HOME/project/src/auth/handler.go
Worktree:   $HOME/project/.claude/worktrees/abc123/src/auth/handler.go
```

Both share the same project structure. `src/auth/handler.go` resolves correctly in either context.

### Anti-Pattern Examples

```
# WRONG: Absolute path in prompt bypasses worktree
"Read $HOME/project/src/auth/handler.go and fix the bug"

# WRONG: cd to main project in Bash command
"Run: cd $HOME/project && go test ./..."

# CORRECT: Relative path — agent resolves from its own CWD
"The bug is in src/auth/handler.go. Read the file and fix it."

# CORRECT: No cd prefix — agent CWD is already worktree root
"Run: go test ./..."
```

## Team Launch Patterns

The `moai worktree new <SPEC-ID> --team` flag launches a Claude or GLM session inside the new worktree based on the current environment. See `.claude/skills/moai-workflow-worktree/SKILL.md` § `--team` Flag for the full P1-P4 decision matrix, detection logic, and example invocations.

> **Two distinct `teammateMode` fields — do not conflate.** The `teammateMode` referenced in the §HARD Rules and P1-P4 detection below is MoAI's own `.claude/settings.local.json` launcher-selection field (values `"tmux"` / `"glm"` / `"claude"`), set by `moai cg` / `moai glm` / `moai cc`. This is SEPARATE from the Claude Code runtime `teammateMode` setting, whose default changed from `auto` to `in-process` as of Claude Code v2.1.179 — with the in-process default, split panes no longer auto-open. Additionally, as of Claude Code v2.1.181, an idle teammate's agent-panel row hides after 30 seconds and reappears on the next turn. These two CC-runtime behaviors govern how teammates are displayed; MoAI's launcher-selection `teammateMode` governs which launcher (`moai cg` / `moai glm` / `moai cc`) the `--team` flag invokes. Both fields happen to share the name `teammateMode`.

### HARD Rules

[ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] CLI launch decisions MUST NOT invoke `AskUserQuestion`. All four launch patterns (P1 tmux+CG → moai glm, P2 tmux+CC → moai cc, P3 no-tmux → syscall.Exec, P4 no-flag → handoff) are selected deterministically from observable state (tmux session presence, `teammateMode`, GLM env vars). This satisfies the Branch Origin Decision Protocol (see `.claude/rules/moai/development/branch-origin-protocol.md` § HARD Rules).

Static guard: `internal/cli/worktree/new_test.go` `TestNew_NoAskUserQuestion` scans all team-launch sources for `AskUserQuestion` / `mcp__askuser` references.

[ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] `--team` and `--tmux` are mutually exclusive at the cobra flag layer. Combining them is rejected before any worktree state is created.

### Swarm Registry Baseline

`.moai/state/swarm/<SPEC-ID>.json` (per-project, 0o600 perms) is written after successful team launch in P1, P2, or P3. The registry is NOT written for P4 (no spawn occurred), and is NOT written if pane spawn fails or worktree creation fails.

The 7-field schema (`spec_id`, `worktree_path`, `branch`, `pane_id`, `mode`, `created_at`, `created_by_pid`) is the baseline for future `moai swarm status / done / kill-all` commands. Those commands are out of scope for the current worktree team-launch contract — the current contract delivers only the registry write.

| `background: true` in Agent frontmatter | 2.1.46 | Non-blocking agent execution |
| `claude --worktree` user flag | 2.1.50 | User-initiated worktree sessions |
| `Ctrl+X Ctrl+K` to kill background agent | 2.1.83 | Kill stuck background agents |
| Worktree CWD isolation fix | **2.1.97** | Prior versions leaked agent CWD back to parent session |
| Stop/SubagentStop hook stability | **2.1.97** | Prior versions failed on long-running sessions |
| `moai doctor` MCP scope duplicate detection | **2.1.110** | Warns on MCP server duplication across `.mcp.json` + settings.json |

**Recommended**: Claude Code **2.1.186 or later** for current background-agent permission-prompt semantics, Opus 4.7+ / 4.8 support, MCP doctor warnings, and Windows CLAUDE_ENV_FILE parity. Minimum baseline: **2.1.97** for worktree isolation.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Worktree not found | Removed manually | Run `moai worktree list` to verify |
| Agent worktree conflicts | Multiple agents same file | Check file ownership in team config |
| Stale worktree branches | Incomplete cleanup | Run `git worktree prune` |
| Hooks not firing | Missing wrapper script | Check `.claude/hooks/moai/` directory |
| `--tmux` not working | Unsupported terminal | Use tmux or iTerm2 (not VS Code, Ghostty) |

## SPEC-to-Worktree Mapping

[ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] Per-step worktree applicability is governed by `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/spec-workflow.md` § SPEC Phase Discipline (canonical source). This table summarizes the mapping for quick reference; on conflict, spec-workflow.md wins.

| Step | Phase   | Worktree?                | Location                              | Lifecycle event              |
|------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1    | Plan    | **NO** (main checkout)   | n/a — `plan/SPEC-XXX` branch on main  | plan PR merged               |
| 2    | Run     | **opt-in (L3 `--worktree` / Route B)** | `~/.moai/worktrees/{project}/{SPEC}/` | run PR merged                |
| 3    | Sync    | **opt-in (L3 `--worktree` / Route B)** — same as Step 2 | same path as Step 2 (do NOT recreate) | sync PR merged               |
| 4    | Cleanup | n/a                      | host checkout                         | `moai worktree done SPEC-XXX` |

(clause updated for v2.1.186 semantics) Worktree usage is user opt-in per the opt-in policy; the default flow runs all phases on a `feat/SPEC-XXX` branch in the main checkout.

[ZONE:Frozen] [HARD] Disposal contract: `moai worktree done SPEC-XXX` MUST run only after BOTH run PR AND sync PR are merged. Premature disposal between Step 2 merge and Step 3 merge breaks Sync.
