# Karpathy Coding Principles — Quick Reference

Mapping Andrej Karpathy's 4 coding principles to MoAI's 6 Agent Core Behaviors with checkpoint questions.

## Principle-to-Behavior Mapping

| Karpathy Principle | MoAI Behavior(s) | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Think Before Coding | Surface Assumptions + Manage Confusion | 95% |
| Simplicity First | Enforce Simplicity + Scope Discipline | 90% |
| Surgical Changes | Scope Discipline + Enforce Simplicity | 85% |
| Goal-Driven Execution | Verify Don't Assume + Push Back | 80% |

## Checkpoint Questions

### Think Before Coding

- Have I listed my assumptions explicitly?
- Is there conflicting information I'm ignoring?
- Am I about to implement without understanding the "why"?

### Simplicity First

- Can this be done in fewer lines? (3x LOC trigger)
- Are these abstractions earning their complexity?
- Would a staff engineer say "why didn't you just..."?

For the ordered reuse-and-dependency-avoidance decision ladder (in-codebase reuse → stdlib → native platform feature → installed dependency → one line → minimum code, applied before writing code), see `.claude/rules/moai/core/moai-constitution.md` § Agent Core Behaviors #4 Enforce Simplicity. The ladder is the capability-source ordering axis that complements these LOC/abstraction checkpoint questions.

### Surgical Changes

- Am I touching only what was asked?
- Does my change match the existing code style?
- Am I refactoring adjacent code "while I'm here"?

### Goal-Driven Execution

- What is the testable completion assertion?
- Have I run the tests to verify?
- Am I claiming success without evidence?
