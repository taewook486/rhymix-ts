# Coding Standards

MoAI-specific coding standards. General coding conventions are not included as Claude already knows them.

## Language Policy

All instruction documents must be in English:
- CLAUDE.md
- Agent definitions (.claude/agents/**/*.md)
- Slash commands (.claude/commands/**/*.md)
- Skill definitions (.claude/skills/**/*.md)
- Hook scripts (.claude/hooks/**/*.py, *.sh)
- Configuration files (.moai/config/**/*.yaml)

User-facing documentation may use multiple languages:
- README.md, CHANGELOG.md
- User guides, API documentation

## File Size Limits

CLAUDE.md should stay under 40,000 characters. This is a MoAI CI-enforceable heuristic; the official Claude Code spec instead targets "under 200 lines per CLAUDE.md" and loads the file in full regardless of length. Any project-local instruction file that also loads in full at every session launch follows the same size discipline.

When approaching the limit, reduce launch-time context (priority order):
- Move detailed content to path-scoped rules (.claude/rules/ with `paths:` frontmatter) so it loads only when matching files are touched
- Move stable doctrine to .moai/docs/ and reference it with a plain prose pointer ("See: .moai/docs/<file>.md")
- Trim content not needed in every session
- Keep only core identity and hard rules inline

Note: `@import` (`@path/to/file`) does NOT reduce context — imported files are expanded and loaded in full at launch (see `.claude/skills/moai-foundation-cc/reference/claude-code-memory-official.md`). Use it for organization, never for size reduction.

## Content Restrictions

Prohibited in instruction documents:
- Code examples for conceptual explanations
- Flow control as code syntax
- Decision trees as code structures
- Emoji characters (except output styles)
- Time estimates or duration predictions

## Footer Convention

Rule files follow a consistent-by-absence footer policy: a `Version` / `Status` / `Classification` footer is OPTIONAL, not required. SSOT-owning canonical-reference rules (files that declare "Single Source of Truth" or carry a `Classification: Canonical Reference` line) SHOULD include a footer stating version, status, and classification. Short path-scoped rules MAY omit a footer entirely — absence is a valid consistent state, not a gap. Do not bulk-add footers to rules that currently lack one; the policy statement (this section) is the deliverable, not uniform footer insertion.

## Duplicate Prevention

Single source of truth principle:
- Each piece of information exists in exactly one location
- Use references (@file) instead of copying content
- Update source file, not copies

## Thin Command Pattern

All slash command files MUST be thin routing wrappers (under 20 LOC body).

Rules:
- Commands route to skills via `Skill("moai")` -- they never contain workflow logic
- All workflow logic belongs in `.claude/skills/moai/workflows/` or skill body
- YAML frontmatter must include: description, argument-hint, allowed-tools (CSV string)
- Root commands may contain router tables but no implementation logic
- Custom commands and skills are merged into one namespace: a `.claude/commands/X.md` and a `.claude/skills/X/SKILL.md` with the same name are the same invocation, and the skill form wins when both exist. Author the workflow once as a skill rather than duplicating it across a command and a skill.

Template:
```
---
description: [One-sentence action description]
argument-hint: "[Optional arg]"
allowed-tools: Skill
---

Use Skill("moai") with arguments: [subcommand] $ARGUMENTS
```

Enforcement: `internal/template/commands_audit_test.go` verifies this pattern on every `go test`.


## Claude Code Version Compatibility

Settings fields introduced by specific Claude Code versions:

| Field | Version | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `effortLevel` | v2.1.110 | Sets CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL; values: low/medium/high/xhigh/max |
| `disableBypassPermissionsMode` | v2.1.111 | Prevents agents from using bypassPermissions mode when true |
| `Bash(timeout=N)` | v2.1.110 | Per-command Bash timeout in ms; max 600,000ms |

When adding new settings fields, update `internal/template/templates/.claude/settings.json.tmpl`
and this compatibility table.

## Paths Frontmatter

Use paths frontmatter for conditional rule loading:

```yaml
---
paths: "**/*.py,**/pyproject.toml"
---
```

This ensures rules load only when working with matching files.

## Bash Risk-Amplifier Doctrine

Source: `github.com/wquguru/harness-books` book1 ch04 (Bash as 风险放大器 / risk amplifier) + appendix A.3 litmus. book1 ch04 names Bash a **risk amplifier**: a compound Bash command (`a && b | c; rm x`) multiplies blast radius — one failed or mis-targeted segment can destroy more than a single failed command. The appendix A.3 litmus states verbatim: *"if your Bash and ReadTool are governed the same way, your risk model is under-developed."* Prior to this doctrine, moai-adk's PreToolUse hook fired uniformly on `Write|Edit|Bash` with no Bash-specific risk tier — Bash (write/irreversible by default) was treated identically to Read/Glob/Grep (read). The appendix A.3 litmus was failing.

### (1) Bash risk-tier classification

The Bash tool is classified as risk-tier **"write/irreversible" by default**, DISTINCT from the Read/Glob/Grep risk-tier **"read"**. Per book1 ch04, the more general a capability, the denser its governance must be; Bash is the most general tool in the harness and therefore the most heavily governed. This is the risk-amplifier (风险放大器) thesis: a single Bash invocation can fan out into file-system mutation, network calls, git history rewrite, and process spawning in one compound expression.

### (2) Compound-command subcommand soft cap

**`BASH_SUBCOMMAND_SOFT_CAP = 5`** is a named, tunable threshold constant (NOT prose like "around five subcommands"). While a Bash command is compound — contains one or more of: pipe `|`, logical-and `&&`, logical-or `||`, sequence `;`, backtick command substitution, or `$(...)` POSIX substitution — the orchestrator/agent SHALL treat a subcommand count exceeding `BASH_SUBCOMMAND_SOFT_CAP` (5) as a **warn condition** that MUST be surfaced either by **splitting into a script file** OR by **explicit delegation** to a sub-agent. "Soft" means **warn-only** — the cap MUST NOT hard-fail or break existing workflows. The `handle-pre-tool.sh` PreToolUse hook emits a warn signal on this condition but exits 0 (fail-open); see (4) below.

### (3) Destructive primitives require explicit confirmation

When a Bash command contains a destructive primitive, the orchestrator/agent SHALL require explicit confirmation EVEN in `bypassPermissions` mode. The destructive-primitive set (non-exhaustive, extend conservatively):

- `rm -rf` — recursive forced deletion
- `git push --force` (and `git push -f`) — force-push rewrites remote history
- `git push --no-verify` — bypasses pre-push hooks (the harness safety net)
- `git reset --hard` — discards uncommitted working-tree state
- SQL `DROP TABLE` / `TRUNCATE` — irreversible data loss
- `chmod -R 777` — recursive world-writable (security hole)

This cross-references the **Implementation Kickoff Approval** human-gate pattern: irreversible / shared-system / hard-to-reverse actions require explicit user confirmation regardless of permission mode. The warn-only hook signal (§4) does NOT enforce this confirmation — confirmation is an orchestrator/agent obligation (doctrine-level), not a hook block.

### (4) Warn-only, fail-open hook signal

The `handle-pre-tool.sh` PreToolUse hook, on detecting a Bash command whose subcommand count exceeds `BASH_SUBCOMMAND_SOFT_CAP`, emits a warn-only signal (a stderr line AND a structured `[moai:bash-risk] WARN` marker) and then exits **0** (fail-open). The hook MUST NOT block, exit non-zero, or otherwise prevent the Bash call from proceeding. A blocking hook here would itself instantiate the death-spiral hazard book1 ch06 warns about. This fail-open constraint is **non-negotiable**. The counter is a **heuristic** — shell-metacharacter counting over-counts in edge cases (e.g., `echo "a && b && c && d && e && f"` inside a quoted string would over-count); the counter is NOT a parser and MUST NOT be the basis of a hard block.

### (5) Additive-only — no regression to CLAUDE.md safeguards

This doctrine is **strictly additive**. It layers a Bash-specific risk tier on top of the existing uniform PreToolUse hook behavior. It does NOT contradict, weaken, or supersede `CLAUDE.md §7 Safe Development Protocol` or `CLAUDE.md §14 Parallel Execution Safeguards`. Both sections remain the authoritative compatibility targets; this doctrine only adds a Bash-specific risk-amplifier lens that was previously absent.

## Advisory-Check Discipline

[HARD] Session-start and Stop advisory checks MUST be cached, asynchronous, or on-demand — never unbounded-blocking.

An **advisory check** is an observational computation run on a latency-sensitive lifecycle path (session start, a Stop hook, a per-turn observer) whose result is informational — a warning, a hint, a status line — and NOT a gate on the user's action. Because its result is advisory, it MUST NOT be allowed to delay the path it runs on for an unbounded amount of time. The natural failure mode is a synchronous scan that is fast on a small project and unboundedly slow on a large one, charged to every session launch.

Rules:

- **Time-box every advisory computation on the critical path.** Wrap it in a deadline (a `context` timeout in Go, or the equivalent in the project language). On deadline exceed, skip the abandoned computation and degrade to an advisory message rather than block. The computation being observational, a missed result costs at most a stale hint — never a stalled session.
- **Prefer cached or on-demand over synchronous recompute.** When an advisory result can be keyed on a cheap invariant (a commit SHA, a file mtime, a content hash), serve it from a cache and recompute only on change. When it is expensive and rarely needed, make it on-demand (an explicit command) rather than an always-on cost.
- **Keep the cost independent of corpus size.** An advisory scan whose cost grows linearly with the number of files, records, or specs will silently degrade every session as the project grows. Bound it to a constant number of subprocesses or passes, or move it off the critical path.
- **Never let an advisory failure block the path.** Errors in an advisory check (a missing tool, an unreadable directory, a timeout) are swallowed silently or surfaced as a non-blocking notice — they never fail the session-start or Stop path.

The time-box is the safety net; caching / on-demand / constant-cost design is the durable fix. A regression guard SHOULD assert the constant-cost property mechanically (e.g. counting subprocess invocations at scale) so the linear-cost pattern cannot silently return.
